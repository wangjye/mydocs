# DSPy Documentation
# Get Started
## Programming—not prompting—LMs
DSPy is the framework for programming—rather than prompting—language models. It allows you to iterate fast on building modular AI systems and offers algorithms for optimizing their prompts and weights, whether you're building simple classifiers, sophisticated RAG pipelines, or Agent loops.
DSPy stands for Declarative Self-improving Python. Instead of brittle prompts, you write compositional Python code and use DSPy to teach your LM to deliver high-quality outputs. This lecture is a good conceptual introduction. Meet the community, seek help, or start contributing via our GitHub repo and Discord server.

Idiomatic DSPy involves using modules, which we define in the rest of this page. However, it's still easy to call the lm you configured above directly. This gives you a unified API and lets you benefit from utilities like automatic caching.
`lm`
```python
```
lm("Say this is a test!", temperature=0.7)  # => ['This is a test!']
lm(messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}])  # => ['This is a test!']
```
lm("Say this is a test!", temperature=0.7)  # => ['This is a test!']
lm(messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}])  # => ['This is a test!']
```
lm("Say this is a test!", temperature=0.7)  # => ['This is a test!']
lm(messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}])  # => ['This is a test!']
## 1) Modules help you describe AI behavior as code, not strings.
To build reliable AI systems, you must iterate fast. But maintaining prompts makes that hard: it forces you to tinker with strings or data every time you change your LM, metrics, or pipeline. Having built over a dozen best-in-class compound LM systems since 2020, we learned this the hard way—and so built DSPy to decouple AI system design from messy incidental choices about specific LMs or prompting strategies.
DSPy shifts your focus from tinkering with prompt strings to programming with structured and declarative natural-language modules. For every AI component in your system, you specify input/output behavior as a signature and select a module to assign a strategy for invoking your LM. DSPy expands your signatures into prompts and parses your typed outputs, so you can compose different modules together into ergonomic, portable, and optimizable AI systems.
Getting Started II: Build DSPy modules for various tasks
Try the examples below after configuring your lm above. Adjust the fields to explore what tasks your LM can do well out of the box. Each tab below sets up a DSPy module, like dspy.Predict, dspy.ChainOfThought, or dspy.ReAct, with a task-specific signature. For example, question -> answer: float tells the module to take a question and to produce a float answer.
MathRAGClassificationInformation ExtractionAgentsMulti-Stage Pipelines
2math = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer: float")
math(question="Two dice are tossed. What is the probability that the sum equals two?")
Possible Output:

    reasoning='When two dice are tossed, each die has 6 faces, resulting in a total of 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes. The sum of the numbers on the two dice equals two only when both dice show a 1. This is just one specific outcome: (1, 1). Therefore, there is only 1 favorable outcome. The probability of the sum being two is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 1/36.',

Getting Started II: Build DSPy modules for various tasks
Try the examples below after configuring your lm above. Adjust the fields to explore what tasks your LM can do well out of the box. Each tab below sets up a DSPy module, like dspy.Predict, dspy.ChainOfThought, or dspy.ReAct, with a task-specific signature. For example, question -> answer: float tells the module to take a question and to produce a float answer.
`dspy.Predict`
`dspy.ChainOfThought`
`dspy.ReAct`
`question -> answer: float`
`float`

Note that DSPy makes it straightforward to optimize multi-stage modules like this. As long as you can evaluate the final output of the system, every DSPy optimizer can tune all of the intermediate modules.
Standard prompts conflate interface (“what should the LM do?”) with implementation (“how do we tell it to do that?”). DSPy isolates the former as signatures so we can infer the latter or learn it from data — in the context of a bigger program.
Even before you start using optimizers, DSPy's modules allow you to script effective LM systems as ergonomic, portable code. Across many tasks and LMs, we maintain signature test suites that assess the reliability of the built-in DSPy adapters. Adapters are the components that map signatures to prompts prior to optimization. If you find a task where a simple prompt consistently outperforms idiomatic DSPy for your LM, consider that a bug and file an issue. We'll use this to improve the built-in adapters.
## 2) Optimizers tune the prompts and weights of your AI modules.
DSPy provides you with the tools to compile high-level code with natural language annotations into the low-level computations, prompts, or weight updates that align your LM with your program’s structure and metrics. If you change your code or your metrics, you can simply re-compile accordingly.
Given a few tens or hundreds of representative inputs of your task and a metric that can measure the quality of your system's outputs, you can use a DSPy optimizer. Different optimizers in DSPy work by synthesizing good few-shot examples for every module, like dspy.BootstrapRS,1 proposing and intelligently exploring better natural-language instructions for every prompt, like dspy.MIPROv2,2 and building datasets for your modules and using them to finetune the LM weights in your system, like dspy.BootstrapFinetune.3
`dspy.BootstrapRS`
`dspy.MIPROv2`
`dspy.BootstrapFinetune`
Getting Started III: Optimizing the LM prompts or weights in DSPy programs
A typical simple optimization run costs on the order of $2 USD and takes around 20 minutes, but be careful when running optimizers with very large LMs or very large datasets.
Optimization can cost as little as a few cents or up to tens of dollars, depending on your LM, dataset, and configuration.

This is a minimal but fully runnable example of setting up a dspy.ReAct agent that answers questions via
search from Wikipedia and then optimizing it using dspy.MIPROv2 in the cheap light mode on 500
question-answer pairs sampled from the HotPotQA dataset.

    return [x['text'] for x in results]
trainset = [x.with_inputs('question') for x in HotPotQA(train_seed=2024, train_size=500).train]
react = dspy.ReAct("question -> answer", tools=[search_wikipedia])
tp = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match, auto="light", num_threads=24)
optimized_react = tp.compile(react, trainset=trainset)
An informal run like this raises ReAct's score from 24% to 51%, by teaching gpt-4o-mini more about the specifics of the task.
Given a retrieval index to search, your favorite dspy.LM, and a small trainset of questions and ground-truth responses, the following code snippet can optimize your RAG system with long outputs against the built-in SemanticF1 metric, which is implemented as a DSPy module.

    def forward(self, question):
        context = search(question, k=self.num_docs)   # defined in tutorial linked below
        return self.respond(context=context, question=question)
tp = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=dspy.evaluate.SemanticF1(decompositional=True), auto="medium", num_threads=24)

This is a minimal but fully runnable example of setting up a dspy.ChainOfThought module that classifies
short texts into one of 77 banking labels and then using dspy.BootstrapFinetune with 2000 text-label pairs

dspy.ChainOfThoughtWithHint, which takes an optional hint at bootstrapping time, to maximize the utility of
the training data. Naturally, hints are not available at test time.

An informal run similar to this on DSPy 2.5.29 raises GPT-4o-mini's score 66% to 87%.
Take the dspy.MIPROv2 optimizer as an example. First, MIPRO starts with the bootstrapping stage. It takes your program, which may be unoptimized at this point, and runs it many times across different inputs to collect traces of input/output behavior for each one of your modules. It filters these traces to keep only those that appear in trajectories scored highly by your metric. Second, MIPRO enters its grounded proposal stage. It previews your DSPy program's code, your data, and traces from running your program, and uses them to draft many potential instructions for every prompt in your program. Third, MIPRO launches the discrete search stage. It samples mini-batches from your training set, proposes a combination of instructions and traces to use for constructing every prompt in the pipeline, and evaluates the candidate program on the mini-batch. Using the resulting score, MIPRO updates a surrogate model that helps the proposals get better over time.
One thing that makes DSPy optimizers so powerful is that they can be composed. You can run dspy.MIPROv2 and use the produced program as an input to dspy.MIPROv2 again or, say, to dspy.BootstrapFinetune to get better results. This is partly the essence of dspy.BetterTogether. Alternatively, you can run the optimizer and then extract the top-5 candidate programs and build a dspy.Ensemble of them. This allows you to scale inference-time compute (e.g., ensembles) as well as DSPy's unique pre-inference time compute (i.e., optimization budget) in highly systematic ways.
`dspy.BetterTogether`
`dspy.Ensemble`
## 3) DSPy's Ecosystem advances open-source AI research.
Compared to monolithic LMs, DSPy's modular paradigm enables a large community to improve the compositional architectures, inference-time strategies, and optimizers for LM programs in an open, distributed way. This gives DSPy users more control, helps them iterate much faster, and allows their programs to get better over time by applying the latest optimizers or modules.
The DSPy research effort started at Stanford NLP in Feb 2022, building on what we had learned from developing early compound LM systems like ColBERT-QA, Baleen, and Hindsight. The first version was released as DSP in Dec 2022 and evolved by Oct 2023 into DSPy. Thanks to 250 contributors, DSPy has introduced tens of thousands of people to building and optimizing modular LM programs.
Since then, DSPy's community has produced a large body of work on optimizers, like MIPROv2, BetterTogether, and LeReT, on program architectures, like STORM, IReRa, and DSPy Assertions, and on successful applications to new problems, like PAPILLON, PATH, WangLab@MEDIQA, UMD's Prompting Case Study, and Haize's Red-Teaming Program, in addition to many open-source projects, production applications, and other use cases.

# Learn Dspy
## Learning DSPy: An Overview
DSPy exposes a very small API that you can learn quickly. However, building a new AI system is a more open-ended journey of iterative development, in which you compose the tools and design patterns of DSPy to optimize for your objectives. The three stages of building AI systems in DSPy are:
1) DSPy Programming. This is about defining your task, its constraints, exploring a few examples, and using that to inform your initial pipeline design.
2) DSPy Evaluation. Once your system starts working, this is the stage where you collect an initial development set, define your DSPy metric, and use these to iterate on your system more systematically.
3) DSPy Optimization. Once you have a way to evaluate your system, you use DSPy optimizers to tune the prompts or weights in your program.
We suggest learning and applying DSPy in this order. For example, it's unproductive to launch optimization runs using a poorly-design program or a bad metric.
---
#### Data
DSPy is a machine learning framework, so working in it involves training sets, development sets, and test sets. For each example in your data, we distinguish typically between three types of values: the inputs, the intermediate labels, and the final label. You can use DSPy effectively without any intermediate or final labels, but you will need at least a few example inputs.
## DSPy Example objects
`Example`
The core data type for data in DSPy is Example. You will use Examples to represent items in your training set and test set.
DSPy Examples are similar to Python dicts but have a few useful utilities. Your DSPy modules will return values of the type Prediction, which is a special sub-class of Example.
`dict`
`Prediction`
When you use DSPy, you will do a lot of evaluation and optimization runs. Your individual datapoints will be of type Example:
qa_pair = dspy.Example(question="This is a question?", answer="This is an answer.")
print(qa_pair)
print(qa_pair.question)
print(qa_pair.answer)
Output:
Example({'question': 'This is a question?', 'answer': 'This is an answer.'}) (input_keys=None)
This is a question?
This is an answer.
```python
qa_pair = dspy.Example(question="This is a question?", answer="This is an answer.")
print(qa_pair)
print(qa_pair.question)
print(qa_pair.answer)
```
qa_pair = dspy.Example(question="This is a question?", answer="This is an answer.")
print(qa_pair)
print(qa_pair.question)
print(qa_pair.answer)
```python
Example({'question': 'This is a question?', 'answer': 'This is an answer.'}) (input_keys=None)
This is a question?
This is an answer.
```
Example({'question': 'This is a question?', 'answer': 'This is an answer.'}) (input_keys=None)
This is a question?
This is an answer.
Examples can have any field keys and any value types, though usually values are strings.
```python
object = Example(field1=value1, field2=value2, field3=value3, ...)
```
object = Example(field1=value1, field2=value2, field3=value3, ...)
You can now express your training set for example as:
```python
trainset = [dspy.Example(report="LONG REPORT 1", summary="short summary 1"), ...]
```
trainset = [dspy.Example(report="LONG REPORT 1", summary="short summary 1"), ...]
### Specifying Input Keys
In traditional ML, there are separated "inputs" and "labels".
In DSPy, the Example objects have a with_inputs() method, which can mark specific fields as inputs. (The rest are just metadata or labels.)
`with_inputs()`
```python
# Single Input.
print(qa_pair.with_inputs("question"))
# Multiple Inputs; be careful about marking your labels as inputs unless you mean it.
print(qa_pair.with_inputs("question", "answer"))
```
# Single Input.
print(qa_pair.with_inputs("question"))
# Multiple Inputs; be careful about marking your labels as inputs unless you mean it.
print(qa_pair.with_inputs("question", "answer"))
Values can be accessed using the .(dot) operator. You can access the value of key name in defined object Example(name="John Doe", job="sleep") through object.name.
`.`
`name`
`Example(name="John Doe", job="sleep")`
`object.name`
To access or exclude certain keys, use inputs() and labels() methods to return new Example objects containing only input or non-input keys, respectively.
`inputs()`
`labels()`
```python
article_summary = dspy.Example(article= "This is an article.", summary= "This is a summary.").with_inputs("article")
input_key_only = article_summary.inputs()
non_input_key_only = article_summary.labels()
print("Example object with Input fields only:", input_key_only)
print("Example object with Non-Input fields only:", non_input_key_only)
```
article_summary = dspy.Example(article= "This is an article.", summary= "This is a summary.").with_inputs("article")
input_key_only = article_summary.inputs()
non_input_key_only = article_summary.labels()
print("Example object with Input fields only:", input_key_only)
print("Example object with Non-Input fields only:", non_input_key_only)
Output
Example object with Input fields only: Example({'article': 'This is an article.'}) (input_keys=None)
Example object with Non-Input fields only: Example({'summary': 'This is a summary.'}) (input_keys=None)
```python
Example object with Input fields only: Example({'article': 'This is an article.'}) (input_keys=None)
Example object with Non-Input fields only: Example({'summary': 'This is a summary.'}) (input_keys=None)
```
Example object with Input fields only: Example({'article': 'This is an article.'}) (input_keys=None)
Example object with Non-Input fields only: Example({'summary': 'This is a summary.'}) (input_keys=None)
---
#### Metrics
DSPy is a machine learning framework, so you must think about your automatic metrics for evaluation (to track your progress) and optimization (so DSPy can make your programs more effective).
## What is a metric and how do I define a metric for my task?
A metric is just a function that will take examples from your data and the output of your system and return a score that quantifies how good the output is. What makes outputs from your system good or bad?
For simple tasks, this could be just "accuracy" or "exact match" or "F1 score". This may be the case for simple classification or short-form QA tasks.
However, for most applications, your system will output long-form outputs. There, your metric should probably be a smaller DSPy program that checks multiple properties of the output (quite possibly using AI feedback from LMs).
Getting this right on the first try is unlikely, but you should start with something simple and iterate.
## Simple metrics
A DSPy metric is just a function in Python that takes example (e.g., from your training or dev set) and the output pred from your DSPy program, and outputs a float (or int or bool) score.
`example`
`pred`
`float`
`int`
`bool`
Your metric should also accept an optional third argument called trace. You can ignore this for a moment, but it will enable some powerful tricks if you want to use your metric for optimization.
`trace`
Here's a simple example of a metric that's comparing example.answer and pred.answer. This particular metric will return a bool.
`example.answer`
`pred.answer`
```python
def validate_answer(example, pred, trace=None):
    return example.answer.lower() == pred.answer.lower()
```
def validate_answer(example, pred, trace=None):
    return example.answer.lower() == pred.answer.lower()
Some people find these utilities (built-in) convenient:
- dspy.evaluate.metrics.answer_exact_match
- dspy.evaluate.metrics.answer_passage_match
`dspy.evaluate.metrics.answer_exact_match`
`dspy.evaluate.metrics.answer_passage_match`
Your metrics could be more complex, e.g. check for multiple properties. The metric below will return a float if trace is None (i.e., if it's used for evaluation or optimization), and will return a bool otherwise (i.e., if it's used to bootstrap demonstrations).
`trace is None`
```python
def validate_context_and_answer(example, pred, trace=None):
    # check the gold label and the predicted answer are the same
    answer_match = example.answer.lower() == pred.answer.lower()
    # check the predicted answer comes from one of the retrieved contexts
    context_match = any((pred.answer.lower() in c) for c in pred.context)
    if trace is None: # if we're doing evaluation or optimization
        return (answer_match + context_match) / 2.0
    else: # if we're doing bootstrapping, i.e. self-generating good demonstrations of each step
        return answer_match and context_match
```
def validate_context_and_answer(example, pred, trace=None):
    # check the gold label and the predicted answer are the same
    answer_match = example.answer.lower() == pred.answer.lower()
    # check the predicted answer comes from one of the retrieved contexts
    context_match = any((pred.answer.lower() in c) for c in pred.context)
    if trace is None: # if we're doing evaluation or optimization
        return (answer_match + context_match) / 2.0
    else: # if we're doing bootstrapping, i.e. self-generating good demonstrations of each step
        return answer_match and context_match
Defining a good metric is an iterative process, so doing some initial evaluations and looking at your data and outputs is key.
## Evaluation
Once you have a metric, you can run evaluations in a simple Python loop.
```python
scores = []
for x in devset:
    pred = program(**x.inputs())
    score = metric(x, pred)
    scores.append(score)
```
scores = []
for x in devset:
    pred = program(**x.inputs())
    score = metric(x, pred)
    scores.append(score)
If you need some utilities, you can also use the built-in Evaluate utility. It can help with things like parallel evaluation (multiple threads) or showing you a sample of inputs/outputs and the metric scores.
`Evaluate`
```python
from dspy.evaluate import Evaluate
# Set up the evaluator, which can be re-used in your code.
evaluator = Evaluate(devset=YOUR_DEVSET, num_threads=1, display_progress=True, display_table=5)
# Launch evaluation.
evaluator(YOUR_PROGRAM, metric=YOUR_METRIC)
```
from dspy.evaluate import Evaluate
# Set up the evaluator, which can be re-used in your code.
evaluator = Evaluate(devset=YOUR_DEVSET, num_threads=1, display_progress=True, display_table=5)
# Launch evaluation.
evaluator(YOUR_PROGRAM, metric=YOUR_METRIC)
## Intermediate: Using AI feedback for your metric
For most applications, your system will output long-form outputs, so your metric should check multiple dimensions of the output using AI feedback from LMs.
This simple signature could come in handy.
```python
# Define the signature for automatic assessments.
class Assess(dspy.Signature):
    """Assess the quality of a tweet along the specified dimension."""
    assessed_text = dspy.InputField()
    assessment_question = dspy.InputField()
    assessment_answer: bool = dspy.OutputField()
```
# Define the signature for automatic assessments.
class Assess(dspy.Signature):
    """Assess the quality of a tweet along the specified dimension."""
    assessed_text = dspy.InputField()
    assessment_question = dspy.InputField()
    assessment_answer: bool = dspy.OutputField()
For example, below is a simple metric that checks a generated tweet (1) answers a given question correctly and (2) whether it's also engaging. We also check that (3) len(tweet) <= 280 characters.
`len(tweet) <= 280`
```python
def metric(gold, pred, trace=None):
    question, answer, tweet = gold.question, gold.answer, pred.output
    engaging = "Does the assessed text make for a self-contained, engaging tweet?"
    correct = f"The text should answer `{question}` with `{answer}`. Does the assessed text contain this answer?"
    correct =  dspy.Predict(Assess)(assessed_text=tweet, assessment_question=correct)
    engaging = dspy.Predict(Assess)(assessed_text=tweet, assessment_question=engaging)
    correct, engaging = [m.assessment_answer for m in [correct, engaging]]
    score = (correct + engaging) if correct and (len(tweet) <= 280) else 0
    if trace is not None: return score >= 2
    return score / 2.0
```
def metric(gold, pred, trace=None):
    question, answer, tweet = gold.question, gold.answer, pred.output
    engaging = "Does the assessed text make for a self-contained, engaging tweet?"
    correct = f"The text should answer `{question}` with `{answer}`. Does the assessed text contain this answer?"
    correct =  dspy.Predict(Assess)(assessed_text=tweet, assessment_question=correct)
    engaging = dspy.Predict(Assess)(assessed_text=tweet, assessment_question=engaging)
    correct, engaging = [m.assessment_answer for m in [correct, engaging]]
    score = (correct + engaging) if correct and (len(tweet) <= 280) else 0
    if trace is not None: return score >= 2
    return score / 2.0
When compiling, trace is not None, and we want to be strict about judging things, so we will only return True if score >= 2. Otherwise, we return a score out of 1.0 (i.e., score / 2.0).
`trace is not None`
`True`
`score >= 2`
`score / 2.0`
## Advanced: Using a DSPy program as your metric
If your metric is itself a DSPy program, one of the most powerful ways to iterate is to compile (optimize) your metric itself. That's usually easy because the output of the metric is usually a simple value (e.g., a score out of 5) so the metric's metric is easy to define and optimize by collecting a few examples.
### Advanced: Accessing the trace
When your metric is used during evaluation runs, DSPy will not try to track the steps of your program.
But during compiling (optimization), DSPy will trace your LM calls. The trace will contain inputs/outputs to each DSPy predictor and you can leverage that to validate intermediate steps for optimization.
```python
def validate_hops(example, pred, trace=None):
    hops = [example.question] + [outputs.query for *_, outputs in trace if 'query' in outputs]
    if max([len(h) for h in hops]) > 100: return False
    if any(dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match_str(hops[idx], hops[:idx], frac=0.8) for idx in range(2, len(hops))): return False
    return True
```
def validate_hops(example, pred, trace=None):
    hops = [example.question] + [outputs.query for *_, outputs in trace if 'query' in outputs]
    if max([len(h) for h in hops]) > 100: return False
    if any(dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match_str(hops[idx], hops[:idx], frac=0.8) for idx in range(2, len(hops))): return False
    return True

#### Evaluation in DSPy
Once you have an initial system, it's time to collect an initial development set so you can refine it more systematically. Even 20 input examples of your task can be useful, though 200 goes a long way. Depending on your metric, you either just need inputs and no labels at all, or you need inputs and the final outputs of your system. (You almost never need labels for the intermediate steps in your program in DSPy.) You can probably find datasets that are adjacent to your task on, say, HuggingFace datasets or in a naturally occuring source like StackExchange. If there's data whose licenses are permissive enough, we suggest you use them. Otherwise, you can label a few examples by hand or start deploying a demo of your system and collect initial data that way.
Next, you should define your DSPy metric. What makes outputs from your system good or bad? Invest in defining metrics and improving them incrementally over time; it's hard to consistently improve what you aren't able to define. A metric is a function that takes examples from your data and takes the output of your system, and returns a score. For simple tasks, this could be just "accuracy", e.g. for simple classification or short-form QA tasks. For most applications, your system will produce long-form outputs, so your metric will be a smaller DSPy program that checks multiple properties of the output. Getting this right on the first try is unlikely: start with something simple and iterate.
Now that you have some data and a metric, run development evaluations on your pipeline designs to understand their tradeoffs. Look at the outputs and the metric scores. This will probably allow you to spot any major issues, and it will define a baseline for your next steps.
If your metric is itself a DSPy program, a powerful way to iterate is to optimize your metric itself. That's usually easy because the output of the metric is usually a simple value (e.g., a score out of 5), so the metric's metric is easy to define and optimize by collecting a few examples.

#### DSPy Optimizers (formerly Teleprompters)
A DSPy optimizer is an algorithm that can tune the parameters of a DSPy program (i.e., the prompts and/or the LM weights) to maximize the metrics you specify, like accuracy.
A typical DSPy optimizer takes three things:
- Your DSPy program. This may be a single module (e.g., dspy.Predict) or a complex multi-module program.
- Your metric. This is a function that evaluates the output of your program, and assigns it a score (higher is better).
- A few training inputs. This may be very small (i.e., only 5 or 10 examples) and incomplete (only inputs to your program, without any labels).
Your DSPy program. This may be a single module (e.g., dspy.Predict) or a complex multi-module program.
`dspy.Predict`
Your metric. This is a function that evaluates the output of your program, and assigns it a score (higher is better).
A few training inputs. This may be very small (i.e., only 5 or 10 examples) and incomplete (only inputs to your program, without any labels).
If you happen to have a lot of data, DSPy can leverage that. But you can start small and get strong results.
Note: Formerly called teleprompters. We are making an official name update, which will be reflected throughout the library and documentation.
## What does a DSPy Optimizer tune? How does it tune them?
Different optimizers in DSPy will tune your program's quality by synthesizing good few-shot examples for every module, like dspy.BootstrapRS,1 proposing and intelligently exploring better natural-language instructions for every prompt, like dspy.MIPROv2,2 and building datasets for your modules and using them to finetune the LM weights in your system, like dspy.BootstrapFinetune.3
`dspy.BootstrapRS`
`dspy.MIPROv2`
`dspy.BootstrapFinetune`
Take the dspy.MIPROv2 optimizer as an example. First, MIPRO starts with the bootstrapping stage. It takes your program, which may be unoptimized at this point, and runs it many times across different inputs to collect traces of input/output behavior for each one of your modules. It filters these traces to keep only those that appear in trajectories scored highly by your metric. Second, MIPRO enters its grounded proposal stage. It previews your DSPy program's code, your data, and traces from running your program, and uses them to draft many potential instructions for every prompt in your program. Third, MIPRO launches the discrete search stage. It samples mini-batches from your training set, proposes a combination of instructions and traces to use for constructing every prompt in the pipeline, and evaluates the candidate program on the mini-batch. Using the resulting score, MIPRO updates a surrogate model that helps the proposals get better over time.
One thing that makes DSPy optimizers so powerful is that they can be composed. You can run dspy.MIPROv2 and use the produced program as an input to dspy.MIPROv2 again or, say, to dspy.BootstrapFinetune to get better results. This is partly the essence of dspy.BetterTogether. Alternatively, you can run the optimizer and then extract the top-5 candidate programs and build a dspy.Ensemble of them. This allows you to scale inference-time compute (e.g., ensembles) as well as DSPy's unique pre-inference time compute (i.e., optimization budget) in highly systematic ways.

### Automatic Few-Shot Learning
These optimizers extend the signature by automatically generating and including optimized examples within the prompt sent to the model, implementing few-shot learning.
- LabeledFewShot: Simply constructs few-shot examples (demos) from provided labeled input and output data points.  Requires k (number of examples for the prompt) and trainset to randomly select k examples from.
- BootstrapFewShot: Uses a teacher module (which defaults to your program) to generate complete demonstrations for every stage of your program, along with labeled examples in trainset. Parameters include max_labeled_demos (the number of demonstrations randomly selected from the trainset) and max_bootstrapped_demos (the number of additional examples generated by the teacher). The bootstrapping process employs the metric to validate demonstrations, including only those that pass the metric in the "compiled" prompt. Advanced: Supports using a teacher program that is a different DSPy program that has compatible structure, for harder tasks.
- BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch: Applies BootstrapFewShot several times with random search over generated demonstrations, and selects the best program over the optimization. Parameters mirror those of BootstrapFewShot, with the addition of num_candidate_programs, which specifies the number of random programs evaluated over the optimization, including candidates of the uncompiled program, LabeledFewShot optimized program, BootstrapFewShot compiled program with unshuffled examples and num_candidate_programs of BootstrapFewShot compiled programs with randomized example sets.
- KNNFewShot. Uses k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to find the nearest training example demonstrations for a given input example. These nearest neighbor demonstrations are then used as the trainset for the BootstrapFewShot optimization process. See this notebook for an example.

### Automatic Instruction Optimization
These optimizers produce optimal instructions for the prompt and, in the case of MIPROv2 can also optimize the set of few-shot demonstrations.
- COPRO: Generates and refines new instructions for each step, and optimizes them with coordinate ascent (hill-climbing using the metric function and the trainset). Parameters include depth which is the number of iterations of prompt improvement the optimizer runs over.
- MIPROv2: Generates instructions and few-shot examples in each step. The instruction generation is data-aware and demonstration-aware. Uses Bayesian Optimization to effectively search over the space of generation instructions/demonstrations across your modules.

### Automatic Finetuning
This optimizer is used to fine-tune the underlying LLM(s).
- BootstrapFinetune: Distills a prompt-based DSPy program into weight updates. The output is a DSPy program that has the same steps, but where each step is conducted by a finetuned model instead of a prompted LM.
`BootstrapFinetune`
### Program Transformations
- Ensemble: Ensembles a set of DSPy programs and either uses the full set or randomly samples a subset into a single program.
`Ensemble`
## Which optimizer should I use?
Ultimately, finding the ‘right’ optimizer to use & the best configuration for your task will require experimentation. Success in DSPy is still an iterative process - getting the best performance on your task will require you to explore and iterate.
That being said, here's the general guidance on getting started:
- If you have very few examples (around 10), start with BootstrapFewShot.
- If you have more data (50 examples or more), try  BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch.
- If you prefer to do instruction optimization only (i.e. you want to keep your prompt 0-shot), use MIPROv2 configured for 0-shot optimization to optimize.
- If you’re willing to use more inference calls to perform longer optimization runs (e.g. 40 trials or more), and have enough data (e.g. 200 examples or more to prevent overfitting) then try MIPROv2.
- If you have been able to use one of these with a large LM (e.g., 7B parameters or above) and need a very efficient program, finetune a small LM for your task with BootstrapFinetune.
## How do I use an optimizer?
They all share this general interface, with some differences in the keyword arguments (hyperparameters). Detailed documentation for key optimizers can be found here, and a full list can be found here.
Let's see this with the most common one, BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch.
```python
from dspy.teleprompt import BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch
# Set up the optimizer: we want to "bootstrap" (i.e., self-generate) 8-shot examples of your program's steps.
# The optimizer will repeat this 10 times (plus some initial attempts) before selecting its best attempt on the devset.
config = dict(max_bootstrapped_demos=4, max_labeled_demos=4, num_candidate_programs=10, num_threads=4)
teleprompter = BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch(metric=YOUR_METRIC_HERE, **config)
optimized_program = teleprompter.compile(YOUR_PROGRAM_HERE, trainset=YOUR_TRAINSET_HERE)
```
from dspy.teleprompt import BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch
# Set up the optimizer: we want to "bootstrap" (i.e., self-generate) 8-shot examples of your program's steps.
# The optimizer will repeat this 10 times (plus some initial attempts) before selecting its best attempt on the devset.
config = dict(max_bootstrapped_demos=4, max_labeled_demos=4, num_candidate_programs=10, num_threads=4)
teleprompter = BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch(metric=YOUR_METRIC_HERE, **config)
optimized_program = teleprompter.compile(YOUR_PROGRAM_HERE, trainset=YOUR_TRAINSET_HERE)
Getting Started III: Optimizing the LM prompts or weights in DSPy programs
A typical simple optimization run costs on the order of $2 USD and takes around ten minutes, but be careful when running optimizers with very large LMs or very large datasets.
Optimizer runs can cost as little as a few cents or up to tens of dollars, depending on your LM, dataset, and configuration.

Given a retrieval index to search, your favorite dspy.LM, and a small trainset of questions and ground-truth responses, the following code snippet can optimize your RAG system with long outputs against the built-in dspy.SemanticF1 metric, which is implemented as a DSPy module.
11class RAG(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_docs=5):
        self.num_docs = num_docs
        self.respond = dspy.ChainOfThought('context, question -> response')
    def forward(self, question):
        context = search(question, k=self.num_docs)   # not defined in this snippet, see link above
        return self.respond(context=context, question=question)
tp = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=dspy.SemanticF1(), auto="medium", num_threads=24)
optimized_rag = tp.compile(RAG(), trainset=trainset, max_bootstrapped_demos=2, max_labeled_demos=2)

short texts into one of 77 banking labels and then using dspy.BootstrapFinetune with 2000 text-label pairs
from the Banking77 to finetune the weights of GPT-4o-mini for this task. We use the variant
dspy.ChainOfThoughtWithHint, which takes an optional hint at bootstrapping time, to maximize the utility of
the training data. Naturally, hints are not available at test time.

## Saving and loading optimizer output
After running a program through an optimizer, it's useful to also save it. At a later point, a program can be loaded from a file and used for inference. For this, the load and save methods can be used.
`load`
`save`
```python
optimized_program.save(YOUR_SAVE_PATH)
```
optimized_program.save(YOUR_SAVE_PATH)
The resulting file is in plain-text JSON format. It contains all the parameters and steps in the source program. You can always read it and see what the optimizer generated. You can add save_field_meta to additionally save the list of fields with the keys, name, field_type, description, and prefix with: `optimized_program.save(YOUR_SAVE_PATH, save_field_meta=True).
`save_field_meta`
`name`
`field_type`
`description`
`prefix`
To load a program from a file, you can instantiate an object from that class and then call the load method on it.
```python
loaded_program = YOUR_PROGRAM_CLASS()
loaded_program.load(path=YOUR_SAVE_PATH)
```
loaded_program = YOUR_PROGRAM_CLASS()
loaded_program.load(path=YOUR_SAVE_PATH)

#### Optimization in DSPy
Once you have a system and a way to evaluate it, you can use DSPy optimizers to tune the prompts or weights in your program. Now it's useful to expand your data collection effort into building a training set and a held-out test set, in addition to the development set you've been using for exploration. For the training set (and its subset, validation set), you can often get substantial value out of 30 examples, but aim for at least 300 examples. Some optimizers accept a trainset only. Others ask for a trainset and a valset. For prompt optimizers, we suggest starting with a 20% split for training and 80% for validation, which is often the opposite of what one does for DNNs.
`trainset`
`valset`
After your first few optimization runs, you are either very happy with everything or you've made a lot of progress but you don't like something about the final program or the metric. At this point, go back to step 1 (Programming in DSPy) and revisit the major questions. Did you define your task well? Do you need to collect (or find online) more data for your problem? Do you want to update your metric? And do you want to use a more sophisticated optimizer? Do you need to consider advanced features like DSPy Assertions? Or, perhaps most importantly, do you want to add some more complexity or steps in your DSPy program itself? Do you want to use multiple optimizers in a sequence?
Iterative development is key. DSPy gives you the pieces to do that incrementally: iterating on your data, your program structure, your assertions, your metric, and your optimization steps. Optimizing complex LM programs is an entirely new paradigm that only exists in DSPy at the time of writing (update: there are now numerous DSPy extension frameworks, so this part is no longer true :-), so naturally the norms around what to do are still emerging. If you need help, we recently created a Discord server for the community.

#### Language Models
The first step in any DSPy code is to set up your language model. For example, you can configure OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini as your default LM as follows.
```python
```
# Authenticate via `OPENAI_API_KEY` env: import os; os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'here'
lm = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini')
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
```
# Authenticate via `OPENAI_API_KEY` env: import os; os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'here'
lm = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini')
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
```
# Authenticate via `OPENAI_API_KEY` env: import os; os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'here'
lm = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini')
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
A few different LMs
OpenAIAnthropicDatabricksLocal LMs on a GPU serverLocal LMs on your laptopOther providers
You can authenticate by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY env variable or passing api_key below.
3import dspy
lm = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini', api_key='YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY')
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
You can authenticate by setting the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env variable or passing api_key below.
3import dspy
lm = dspy.LM('anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229', api_key='YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
If you're on the Databricks platform, authentication is automatic via their SDK. If not, you can set the env variables DATABRICKS_API_KEY and DATABRICKS_API_BASE, or pass api_key and api_base below.
3import dspy
lm = dspy.LM('databricks/databricks-meta-llama-3-1-70b-instruct')
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
First, install SGLang and launch its server with your LM.
> pip install "sglang[all]"
> pip install flashinfer -i https://flashinfer.ai/whl/cu121/torch2.4/ 
> CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -m sglang.launch_server --port 7501 --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct
Then, connect to it from your DSPy code as an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
4lm = dspy.LM("openai/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct",
                 api_base="http://localhost:7501/v1",  # ensure this points to your port
                 api_key="", model_type='chat')
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
First, install Ollama and launch its server with your LM.
> curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
> ollama run llama3.2:1b
Then, connect to it from your DSPy code.
3import dspy
lm = dspy.LM('ollama_chat/llama3.2', api_base='http://localhost:11434', api_key='')
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
In DSPy, you can use any of the dozens of LLM providers supported by LiteLLM. Simply follow their instructions for which {PROVIDER}_API_KEY to set and how to write pass the {provider_name}/{model_name} to the constructor.
Some examples:
anyscale/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1, with ANYSCALE_API_KEY
together_ai/togethercomputer/llama-2-70b-chat, with TOGETHERAI_API_KEY
sagemaker/<your-endpoint-name>, with AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_REGION_NAME
azure/<your_deployment_name>, with AZURE_API_KEY, AZURE_API_BASE, AZURE_API_VERSION, and the optional AZURE_AD_TOKEN and AZURE_API_TYPE
If your provider offers an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, just add an openai/ prefix to your full model name.

## Calling the LM directly.
It's easy to call the lm you configured above directly. This gives you a unified API and lets you benefit from utilities like automatic caching.
`lm`
```python
```
lm("Say this is a test!", temperature=0.7)  # => ['This is a test!']
lm(messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}])  # => ['This is a test!']
```
lm("Say this is a test!", temperature=0.7)  # => ['This is a test!']
lm(messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}])  # => ['This is a test!']
```
lm("Say this is a test!", temperature=0.7)  # => ['This is a test!']
lm(messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}])  # => ['This is a test!']
## Using the LM with DSPy modules.
Idiomatic DSPy involves using modules, which we discuss in the next guide.
6# Define a module (ChainOfThought) and assign it a signature (return an answer, given a question).
qa = dspy.ChainOfThought('question -> answer')
# Run with the default LM configured with `dspy.configure` above.
response = qa(question="How many floors are in the castle David Gregory inherited?")
print(response.answer)
Possible Output:
The castle David Gregory inherited has 7 floors.
```python
```
# Define a module (ChainOfThought) and assign it a signature (return an answer, given a question).
qa = dspy.ChainOfThought('question -> answer')
# Run with the default LM configured with `dspy.configure` above.
response = qa(question="How many floors are in the castle David Gregory inherited?")
print(response.answer)
```
# Define a module (ChainOfThought) and assign it a signature (return an answer, given a question).
qa = dspy.ChainOfThought('question -> answer')
# Run with the default LM configured with `dspy.configure` above.
response = qa(question="How many floors are in the castle David Gregory inherited?")
print(response.answer)
```
# Define a module (ChainOfThought) and assign it a signature (return an answer, given a question).
qa = dspy.ChainOfThought('question -> answer')
# Run with the default LM configured with `dspy.configure` above.
response = qa(question="How many floors are in the castle David Gregory inherited?")
print(response.answer)
```python
The castle David Gregory inherited has 7 floors.
```
The castle David Gregory inherited has 7 floors.
## Using multiple LMs.
You can change the default LM globally with dspy.configure or change it inside a block of code with dspy.context.
`dspy.configure`
`dspy.context`
Tip
Using dspy.configure and dspy.context is thread-safe!

print('GPT-4o-mini:', response.answer)

```
GPT-4o: The number of floors in the castle David Gregory inherited cannot be determined with the information provided.
GPT-3.5-turbo: The castle David Gregory inherited has 7 floors.
## Configuring LM generation.
For any LM, you can configure any of the following attributes at initialization or in each subsequent call.
```python
```
gpt_4o_mini = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.9, max_tokens=3000, stop=None, cache=False)
```
gpt_4o_mini = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.9, max_tokens=3000, stop=None, cache=False)
```
gpt_4o_mini = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.9, max_tokens=3000, stop=None, cache=False)
By default LMs in DSPy are cached. If you repeat the same call, you will get the same outputs. But you can turn off caching by setting cache=False.
`cache=False`
## Inspecting output and usage metadata.
Every LM object maintains the history of its interactions, including inputs, outputs, token usage (and $$$ cost), and metadata.
len(lm.history)  # e.g., 3 calls to the LM
lm.history[-1].keys()  # access the last call to the LM, with all metadata
```
len(lm.history)  # e.g., 3 calls to the LM
lm.history[-1].keys()  # access the last call to the LM, with all metadata
```
len(lm.history)  # e.g., 3 calls to the LM
lm.history[-1].keys()  # access the last call to the LM, with all metadata
Output:
dict_keys(['prompt', 'messages', 'kwargs', 'response', 'outputs', 'usage', 'cost'])
```python
dict_keys(['prompt', 'messages', 'kwargs', 'response', 'outputs', 'usage', 'cost'])
```
dict_keys(['prompt', 'messages', 'kwargs', 'response', 'outputs', 'usage', 'cost'])
### Advanced: Building customer LMs and writing your own Adapters.
Though rarely needed, you can write custom LMs by inheriting from dspy.BaseLM. Another advanced layer in the DSPy ecosystem is that of adapters, which sit between DSPy signatures and LMs. A future version of this guide will discuss these advanced features, though you likely don't need them.
`dspy.BaseLM`

#### Modules
A DSPy module is a building block for programs that use LMs.
- Each built-in module abstracts a prompting technique (like chain of thought or ReAct). Crucially, they are generalized to handle any signature.
- A DSPy module has learnable parameters (i.e., the little pieces comprising the prompt and the LM weights) and can be invoked (called) to process inputs and return outputs.
- Multiple modules can be composed into bigger modules (programs). DSPy modules are inspired directly by NN modules in PyTorch, but applied to LM programs.

## How do I use a built-in module, like dspy.Predict or dspy.ChainOfThought?
`dspy.Predict`
`dspy.ChainOfThought`
Let's start with the most fundamental module, dspy.Predict. Internally, all other DSPy modules are built using dspy.Predict. We'll assume you are already at least a little familiar with DSPy signatures, which are declarative specs for defining the behavior of any module we use in DSPy.
To use a module, we first declare it by giving it a signature. Then we call the module with the input arguments, and extract the output fields!
sentence = "it's a charming and often affecting journey."  # example from the SST-2 dataset.
# 1) Declare with a signature.
classify = dspy.Predict('sentence -> sentiment: bool')
# 2) Call with input argument(s). 
response = classify(sentence=sentence)
# 3) Access the output.
print(response.sentiment)
Output:
True
```python
sentence = "it's a charming and often affecting journey."  # example from the SST-2 dataset.
# 1) Declare with a signature.
classify = dspy.Predict('sentence -> sentiment: bool')
# 2) Call with input argument(s). 
response = classify(sentence=sentence)
# 3) Access the output.
print(response.sentiment)
```
sentence = "it's a charming and often affecting journey."  # example from the SST-2 dataset.
# 1) Declare with a signature.
classify = dspy.Predict('sentence -> sentiment: bool')
# 2) Call with input argument(s). 
response = classify(sentence=sentence)
# 3) Access the output.
print(response.sentiment)
```python
True
```
True
When we declare a module, we can pass configuration keys to it.
Below, we'll pass n=5 to request five completions. We can also pass temperature or max_len, etc.
`n=5`
`temperature`
`max_len`
Let's use dspy.ChainOfThought. In many cases, simply swapping dspy.ChainOfThought in place of dspy.Predict improves quality.
question = "What's something great about the ColBERT retrieval model?"
# 1) Declare with a signature, and pass some config.
classify = dspy.ChainOfThought('question -> answer', n=5)
# 2) Call with input argument.
response = classify(question=question)
# 3) Access the outputs.
response.completions.answer
Possible Output:
['One great thing about the ColBERT retrieval model is its superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to other models.',
 'Its ability to efficiently retrieve relevant information from large document collections.',
 'One great thing about the ColBERT retrieval model is its superior performance compared to other models and its efficient use of pre-trained language models.',
 'One great thing about the ColBERT retrieval model is its superior efficiency and accuracy compared to other models.',
 'One great thing about the ColBERT retrieval model is its ability to incorporate user feedback and support complex queries.']
```python

Let's discuss the output object here. The dspy.ChainOfThought module will generally inject a reasoning before the output field(s) of your signature.
`reasoning`
Let's inspect the (first) reasoning and answer!
print(f"Reasoning: {response.reasoning}")
print(f"Answer: {response.answer}")
Possible Output:
Reasoning: We can consider the fact that ColBERT has shown to outperform other state-of-the-art retrieval models in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. It uses contextualized embeddings and performs document retrieval in a way that is both accurate and scalable.
Answer: One great thing about the ColBERT retrieval model is its superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to other models.
```python
print(f"Reasoning: {response.reasoning}")
print(f"Answer: {response.answer}")
```
print(f"Reasoning: {response.reasoning}")
print(f"Answer: {response.answer}")
```python
Reasoning: We can consider the fact that ColBERT has shown to outperform other state-of-the-art retrieval models in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. It uses contextualized embeddings and performs document retrieval in a way that is both accurate and scalable.

Answer: One great thing about the ColBERT retrieval model is its superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to other models.
This is accessible whether we request one or many completions.
We can also access the different completions as a list of Predictions or as several lists, one for each field.
`Prediction`
response.completions[3].reasoning == response.completions.reasoning[3]
Output:
True
```python
response.completions[3].reasoning == response.completions.reasoning[3]
```
response.completions[3].reasoning == response.completions.reasoning[3]
True
## What other DSPy modules are there? How can I use them?
The others are very similar. They mainly change the internal behavior with which your signature is implemented!
- dspy.Predict: Basic predictor. Does not modify the signature. Handles the key forms of learning (i.e., storing the instructions and demonstrations and updates to the LM).
- dspy.ChainOfThought: Teaches the LM to think step-by-step before committing to the signature's response.
- dspy.ProgramOfThought: Teaches the LM to output code, whose execution results will dictate the response.
- dspy.ReAct: An agent that can use tools to implement the given signature.
- dspy.MultiChainComparison: Can compare multiple outputs from ChainOfThought to produce a final prediction.

We also have some function-style modules:
- dspy.majority: Can do basic voting to return the most popular response from a set of predictions.
`dspy.majority`

## How do I compose multiple modules into a bigger program?
DSPy is just Python code that uses modules in any control flow you like, with a little magic internally at compile time to trace your LM calls. What this means is that, you can just call the modules freely. No weird abstractions for chaining calls. This is basically PyTorch's design approach for define-by-run / dynamic computation graphs. Refer to the intro tutorials for examples.
`compile`
---
#### Programming in DSPy
DSPy is a bet on writing code instead of strings. In other words, building the right control flow is crucial. Start by defining your task. What are the inputs to your system and what should your system produce as output? Is it a chatbot over your data or perhaps a code assistant? Or maybe a system for translation, for highlighting snippets from search results, or for generating reports with citations?
Next, define your initial pipeline. Can your DSPy program just be a single module or do you need to break it down into a few steps? Do you need retrieval or other tools, like a calculator or a calendar API? Is there a typical workflow for solving your problem in multiple well-scoped steps, or do you want more open-ended tool use with agents for your task? Think about these but start simple, perhaps with just a single dspy.ChainOfThought module, then add complexity incrementally based on observations.
`dspy.ChainOfThought`
As you do this, craft and try a handful of examples of the inputs to your program. Consider using a powerful LM at this point, or a couple of different LMs, just to understand what's possible. Record interesting (both easy and hard) examples you try. This will be useful when you are doing evaluation and optimization later.
Conventional prompts couple your fundamental system architecture with incidental choices not portable to new LMs, objectives, or pipelines. A conventional prompt asks the LM to take some inputs and produce some outputs of certain types (a signature), formats the inputs in certain ways and requests outputs in a form it can parse accurately (an adapter), asks the LM to apply certain strategies like "thinking step by step" or using tools (a module's logic), and relies on substantial trial-and-error to discover the right way to ask each LM to do this (a form of manual optimization).
DSPy separates these concerns and automates the lower-level ones until you need to consider them. This allow you to write much shorter code, with much higher portability. For example, if you write a program using DSPy modules, you can swap the LM or its adapter without changing the rest of your logic. Or you can exchange one module, like dspy.ChainOfThought, with another, like dspy.ProgramOfThought, without modifying your signatures. When you're ready to use optimizers, the same program can have its prompts optimized or its LM weights fine-tuned.
`dspy.ProgramOfThought`
---
#### Signatures
When we assign tasks to LMs in DSPy, we specify the behavior we need as a Signature.
A signature is a declarative specification of input/output behavior of a DSPy module. Signatures allow you to tell the LM what it needs to do, rather than specify how we should ask the LM to do it.
You're probably familiar with function signatures, which specify the input and output arguments and their types. DSPy signatures are similar, but with a couple of differences. While typical function signatures just describe things, DSPy Signatures declare and initialize the behavior of modules. Moreover, the field names matter in DSPy Signatures. You express semantic roles in plain English: a question is different from an answer, a sql_query is different from python_code.
`question`
`answer`
`sql_query`
`python_code`
## Why should I use a DSPy Signature?
For modular and clean code, in which LM calls can be optimized into high-quality prompts (or automatic finetunes). Most people coerce LMs to do tasks by hacking long, brittle prompts. Or by collecting/generating data for fine-tuning. Writing signatures is far more modular, adaptive, and reproducible than hacking at prompts or finetunes. The DSPy compiler will figure out how to build a highly-optimized prompt for your LM (or finetune your small LM) for your signature, on your data, and within your pipeline. In many cases, we found that compiling leads to better prompts than humans write. Not because DSPy optimizers are more creative than humans, but simply because they can try more things and tune the metrics directly.
## Inline DSPy Signatures
Signatures can be defined as a short string, with argument names and optional types that define semantic roles for inputs/outputs.
- Question Answering: "question -> answer", which is equivalent to "question: str -> answer: str" as the default type is always str
- Sentiment Classification: "sentence -> sentiment: bool", e.g. True if positive
- Summarization: "document -> summary"
Question Answering: "question -> answer", which is equivalent to "question: str -> answer: str" as the default type is always str
`"question -> answer"`
`"question: str -> answer: str"`
`str`
Sentiment Classification: "sentence -> sentiment: bool", e.g. True if positive
`"sentence -> sentiment: bool"`
`True`
Summarization: "document -> summary"
`"document -> summary"`
Your signatures can also have multiple input/output fields with types:
- Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering: "context: list[str], question: str -> answer: str"
- Multiple-Choice Question Answering with Reasoning: "question, choices: list[str] -> reasoning: str, selection: int"
Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering: "context: list[str], question: str -> answer: str"
`"context: list[str], question: str -> answer: str"`
Multiple-Choice Question Answering with Reasoning: "question, choices: list[str] -> reasoning: str, selection: int"
`"question, choices: list[str] -> reasoning: str, selection: int"`
Tip: For fields, any valid variable names work! Field names should be semantically meaningful, but start simple and don't prematurely optimize keywords! Leave that kind of hacking to the DSPy compiler. For example, for summarization, it's probably fine to say "document -> summary", "text -> gist", or "long_context -> tldr".
`"text -> gist"`
`"long_context -> tldr"`
### Example A: Sentiment Classification
sentence = "it's a charming and often affecting journey."  # example from the SST-2 dataset.
classify = dspy.Predict('sentence -> sentiment: bool')  # we'll see an example with Literal[] later
classify(sentence=sentence).sentiment

Many DSPy modules (except dspy.Predict) return auxiliary information by expanding your signature under the hood.
`dspy.Predict`
For example, dspy.ChainOfThought also adds a reasoning field that includes the LM's reasoning before it generates the output summary.
`dspy.ChainOfThought`
`reasoning`
`summary`
print("Reasoning:", response.reasoning)
Possible Output:
Reasoning: We need to highlight Lee's performance for West Ham, his loan spells in League One, and his new contract with Barnsley. We also need to mention that his contract length has not been disclosed.

## Class-based DSPy Signatures
For some advanced tasks, you need more verbose signatures. This is typically to:
- Clarify something about the nature of the task (expressed below as a docstring).
- Supply hints on the nature of an input field, expressed as a desc keyword argument for dspy.InputField.
- Supply constraints on an output field, expressed as a desc keyword argument for dspy.OutputField.
Clarify something about the nature of the task (expressed below as a docstring).
`docstring`
Supply hints on the nature of an input field, expressed as a desc keyword argument for dspy.InputField.
`desc`
`dspy.InputField`
Supply constraints on an output field, expressed as a desc keyword argument for dspy.OutputField.
`dspy.OutputField`
### Example C: Classification
from typing import Literal
class Emotion(dspy.Signature):
    """Classify emotion."""
    sentence: str = dspy.InputField()
    sentiment: Literal['sadness', 'joy', 'love', 'anger', 'fear', 'surprise'] = dspy.OutputField()
sentence = "i started feeling a little vulnerable when the giant spotlight started blinding me"  # from dair-ai/emotion
classify = dspy.Predict(Emotion)
classify(sentence=sentence)
Possible Output:
Prediction(
    sentiment='fear'
)
```python
from typing import Literal
class Emotion(dspy.Signature):
    """Classify emotion."""
    sentence: str = dspy.InputField()
    sentiment: Literal['sadness', 'joy', 'love', 'anger', 'fear', 'surprise'] = dspy.OutputField()
sentence = "i started feeling a little vulnerable when the giant spotlight started blinding me"  # from dair-ai/emotion
classify = dspy.Predict(Emotion)
classify(sentence=sentence)
```
from typing import Literal
class Emotion(dspy.Signature):
    """Classify emotion."""
    sentence: str = dspy.InputField()
    sentiment: Literal['sadness', 'joy', 'love', 'anger', 'fear', 'surprise'] = dspy.OutputField()
sentence = "i started feeling a little vulnerable when the giant spotlight started blinding me"  # from dair-ai/emotion
classify = dspy.Predict(Emotion)
classify(sentence=sentence)
```python
Prediction(
    sentiment='fear'
)
```
Prediction(
    sentiment='fear'
)
Tip: There's nothing wrong with specifying your requests to the LM more clearly. Class-based Signatures help you with that. However, don't prematurely tune the keywords of your signature by hand. The DSPy optimizers will likely do a better job (and will transfer better across LMs).
### Example D: A metric that evaluates faithfulness to citations
class CheckCitationFaithfulness(dspy.Signature):
    """Verify that the text is based on the provided context."""
    context: str = dspy.InputField(desc="facts here are assumed to be true")
    text: str = dspy.InputField()
    faithfulness: bool = dspy.OutputField()
    evidence: dict[str, list[str]] = dspy.OutputField(desc="Supporting evidence for claims")
context = "The 21-year-old made seven appearances for the Hammers and netted his only goal for them in a Europa League qualification round match against Andorran side FC Lustrains last season.

text = "Lee scored 3 goals for Colchester United."
faithfulness = dspy.ChainOfThought(CheckCitationFaithfulness)

## Using signatures to build modules & compiling them
While signatures are convenient for prototyping with structured inputs/outputs, that's not the only reason to use them!
You should compose multiple signatures into bigger DSPy modules and compile these modules into optimized prompts and finetunes.

We are working on upgrading more tutorials and other examples to DSPy 2.5 from earlier DSPy versions.

### Tutorial: Agents¶
Tutorial: Agents¶Let's walk through a quick example of setting up a dspy.ReAct agent with a couple of tools and optimizing it to conduct advanced browsing for multi-hop search.
Install the latest DSPy via pip install -U dspy and follow along.
In this tutorial, we'll use an extremely small LM, Meta's Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct which has 3 billion parameters.
A model like this is not very reliable out of the box for long or complex agent loops. However, it's extremely fast and cheap to host, as it needs very little RAM.
You might be able to host the 3B model on your laptop with Ollama, on your GPU server with SGLang, or via a provider that hosts it for you like Databricks or Together.
In the snippet below, we'll configure our main LM as Llama-3.2-3B. We'll also set up a larger LM, i.e. GPT-4o, as a teacher that we'll invoke a very small number of times to help teach the small LM.
In [1]:
Copied!
import dspy
llama3b = dspy.LM('<provider>/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct', temperature=0.7)
gpt4o = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o', temperature=0.7)
dspy.configure(lm=llama3b)
import dspy
llama3b = dspy.LM('/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct', temperature=0.7)
gpt4o = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o', temperature=0.7)
dspy.configure(lm=llama3b)
Let's load a dataset for our task. We'll load examples from the HoVer multi-hop task, where the input is a (really!) complex claim and the output we're seeking is the set of Wikipedia pages that are required to fact-check that claim.
In [2]:
Copied!
import random
from dspy.datasets import DataLoader
kwargs = dict(fields=("claim", "supporting_facts", "hpqa_id", "num_hops"), input_keys=("claim",))
hover = DataLoader().from_huggingface(dataset_name="hover-nlp/hover", split="train", trust_remote_code=True, **kwargs)
hpqa_ids = set()
hover = [
    dspy.Example(claim=x.claim, titles=list(set([y["key"] for y in x.supporting_facts]))).with_inputs("claim")
    for x in hover
    if x["num_hops"] == 3 and x["hpqa_id"] not in hpqa_ids and not hpqa_ids.add(x["hpqa_id"])
]
random.Random(0).shuffle(hover)
trainset, devset, testset = hover[:100], hover[100:200], hover[650:]
import random
from dspy.datasets import DataLoader
kwargs = dict(fields=("claim", "supporting_facts", "hpqa_id", "num_hops"), input_keys=("claim",))
hover = DataLoader().from_huggingface(dataset_name="hover-nlp/hover", split="train", trust_remote_code=True, **kwargs)
hpqa_ids = set()
hover = [
    dspy.Example(claim=x.claim, titles=list(set([y["key"] for y in x.supporting_facts]))).with_inputs("claim")
    for x in hover
    if x["num_hops"] == 3 and x["hpqa_id"] not in hpqa_ids and not hpqa_ids.add(x["hpqa_id"])
]
random.Random(0).shuffle(hover)
trainset, devset, testset = hover[:100], hover[100:200], hover[650:]
Let's view an example of this task:
In [3]:
Copied!
example = trainset[0]
print("Claim:", example.claim)
print("Pages that must be retrieved:", example.titles)
example = trainset[0]
print("Claim:", example.claim)
print("Pages that must be retrieved:", example.titles)
Claim: This director is known for his work on Miss Potter. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presents the award in which he was nominated for his work in "Babe".
Pages that must be retrieved: ['Miss Potter', 'Chris Noonan', 'Academy Award for Best Director']
Now, let's define a function to do the search in Wikipedia. We'll rely on a ColBERTv2 server that can search the "abstracts" (i.e., first paragraphs) of every article that existed in Wikipedia in 2017, which is the data used in HoVer.
In [4]:
Copied!
DOCS = {}
def search(query: str, k: int) -> list[str]:
    results = dspy.ColBERTv2(url='http://20.102.90.50:2017/wiki17_abstracts')(query, k=k)
    results = [x['text'] for x in results]
    for result in results:
        title, text = result.split(" | ", 1)
        DOCS[title] = text
    return results
DOCS = {}
def search(query: str, k: int) -> list[str]:
    results = dspy.ColBERTv2(url='http://20.102.90.50:2017/wiki17_abstracts')(query, k=k)
    results = [x['text'] for x in results]
    for result in results:
        title, text = result.split(" | ", 1)
        DOCS[title] = text
    return results
Now, let's use the search function to define two tools for our ReAct agent:
In [5]:
Copied!
def search_wikipedia(query: str) -> list[str]:
    """Returns top-5 results and then the titles of the top-5 to top-30 results."""
    topK = search(query, 30)
    titles, topK = [f"`{x.split(' | ')[0]}`" for x in topK[5:30]], topK[:5]
    return topK + [f"Other retrieved pages have titles: {', '.join(titles)}."]
def lookup_wikipedia(title: str) -> str:
    """Returns the text of the Wikipedia page, if it exists."""
    if title in DOCS:
        return DOCS[title]
    results = [x for x in search(title, 10) if x.startswith(title + " | ")]
    if not results:
        return f"No Wikipedia page found for title: {title}"
    return results[0]
def search_wikipedia(query: str) -> list[str]:
    """Returns top-5 results and then the titles of the top-5 to top-30 results."""
    topK = search(query, 30)
    titles, topK = [f"`{x.split(' | ')[0]}`" for x in topK[5:30]], topK[:5]
    return topK + [f"Other retrieved pages have titles: {', '.join(titles)}."]
def lookup_wikipedia(title: str) -> str:
    """Returns the text of the Wikipedia page, if it exists."""
    if title in DOCS:
        return DOCS[title]
    results = [x for x in search(title, 10) if x.startswith(title + " | ")]
    if not results:
        return f"No Wikipedia page found for title: {title}"
    return results[0]
Now, let's define the ReAct agent in DSPy. It's going to be super simple: it'll take a claim and produce a list titles: list[str].
We'll instruct it to find all Wikipedia titles that are needed to fact-check the claim.
In [6]:
Copied!
instructions = "Find all Wikipedia titles relevant to verifying (or refuting) the claim."
signature = dspy.Signature("claim -> titles: list[str]", instructions)
react = dspy.ReAct(signature, tools=[search_wikipedia, lookup_wikipedia], max_iters=20)
instructions = "Find all Wikipedia titles relevant to verifying (or refuting) the claim."
signature = dspy.Signature("claim -> titles: list[str]", instructions)
react = dspy.ReAct(signature, tools=[search_wikipedia, lookup_wikipedia], max_iters=20)
Let's try it with a really simple claim to see if our tiny 3B model can do it!
In [7]:
Copied!
react(claim="David Gregory was born in 1625.").titles[:3]
react(claim="David Gregory was born in 1625.").titles[:3]
Out[7]:
['David Gregory (physician)', 'David A. Gregory', 'David Harry Gregory']
Great. Now let's set up an evaluation metric, top5_recall.
It will return the fraction of the gold pages (which are always 3) that are retrieved in the top-5 titles returned by the agent.
In [9]:
Copied!
def top5_recall(example, pred, trace=None):
    gold_titles = example.titles
    recall = sum(x in pred.titles[:5] for x in gold_titles) / len(gold_titles)
    # If we're "bootstrapping" for optimization, return True if and only if the recall is perfect.
    if trace is not None:
        return recall >= 1.0
    # If we're just doing inference, just measure the recall.
    return recall
evaluate = dspy.Evaluate(devset=devset, metric=top5_recall, num_threads=16, display_progress=True, display_table=5)
def top5_recall(example, pred, trace=None):
    gold_titles = example.titles
    recall = sum(x in pred.titles[:5] for x in gold_titles) / len(gold_titles)
    # If we're "bootstrapping" for optimization, return True if and only if the recall is perfect.
    if trace is not None:
        return recall >= 1.0
    # If we're just doing inference, just measure the recall.
    return recall
evaluate = dspy.Evaluate(devset=devset, metric=top5_recall, num_threads=16, display_progress=True, display_table=5)
Let's evaluate our off-the-shelf agent, with Llama-3.2-8B, to see how far we can go already.
This model is tiny, so it can complain fairly often. Let's wrap it in a try/except block to hide those.
In [10]:

Wow. It only scores 8% in terms of recall. Not that good!
Let's now optimize the two prompts inside dspy.ReAct jointly to maximize the recall of our agent. This may take around 30 minutes and make some $5 worth of calls to GPT-4o to optimize Llama-3.2-3B.

Awesome. It looks like the system improved drastically from 8% recall to around 40% recall. That was a pretty straightforward approach, but DSPy gives you many tools to continue iterating on this from here.
Next, let's inspect the optimized prompts to understand what it has learned. We'll run one query and then inspect the last two prompts, which will show us the prompts used for both ReAct sub-modules, the one that does the agentic loop and the other than prepares the final results.

The better known of the two, "Amaryllis belladonna", is a native of the Western Cape region of South Africa, particularly the rocky southwest area between the Olifants River Valley to Knysna. For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names "Amaryllis" and "Hippeastrum", one result of which is that the common name "amaryllis" is mainly used for cultivars of the genus "Hippeastrum", widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors. Plants of the genus "Amaryllis" are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March. This is one of numerous genera with the common name "lily" due to their flower shape and growth habit. However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, "Lilium".»

John Kingsley "Joe" Orton (1 January 1933 – 9 August 1967) was an English playwright and author. His public career was short but prolific, lasting from 1964 until his death three years later. During this brief period he shocked, outraged, and amused audiences with his scandalous black comedies. The adjective "Ortonesque" is sometimes used to refer to work characterised by a similarly dark yet farcical cynicism.

The claim states that the authors of the unproduced script for "Up Against It" are both playwrights. Investigation revealed that Bernard-Marie Koltès wrote the unproduced script, and further research confirmed that Joe Orton was also a playwright who wrote the script. Therefore, both playwrights are indeed the authors of the unproduced script for "Up Against It".

Tutorial: Agents¶Let's walk through a quick example of setting up a dspy.ReAct agent with a couple of tools and optimizing it to conduct advanced browsing for multi-hop search.
Install the latest DSPy via pip install -U dspy and follow along.
In this tutorial, we'll use an extremely small LM, Meta's Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct which has 3 billion parameters.
A model like this is not very reliable out of the box for long or complex agent loops. However, it's extremely fast and cheap to host, as it needs very little RAM.
You might be able to host the 3B model on your laptop with Ollama, on your GPU server with SGLang, or via a provider that hosts it for you like Databricks or Together.
In the snippet below, we'll configure our main LM as Llama-3.2-3B. We'll also set up a larger LM, i.e. GPT-4o, as a teacher that we'll invoke a very small number of times to help teach the small LM.
In [1]:
Copied!
import dspy
llama3b = dspy.LM('<provider>/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct', temperature=0.7)
gpt4o = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o', temperature=0.7)
dspy.configure(lm=llama3b)
import dspy
llama3b = dspy.LM('/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct', temperature=0.7)
gpt4o = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o', temperature=0.7)
dspy.configure(lm=llama3b)
Let's load a dataset for our task. We'll load examples from the HoVer multi-hop task, where the input is a (really!) complex claim and the output we're seeking is the set of Wikipedia pages that are required to fact-check that claim.
In [2]:
Copied!
import random
from dspy.datasets import DataLoader
kwargs = dict(fields=("claim", "supporting_facts", "hpqa_id", "num_hops"), input_keys=("claim",))
hover = DataLoader().from_huggingface(dataset_name="hover-nlp/hover", split="train", trust_remote_code=True, **kwargs)
hpqa_ids = set()
hover = [
    dspy.Example(claim=x.claim, titles=list(set([y["key"] for y in x.supporting_facts]))).with_inputs("claim")
    for x in hover
    if x["num_hops"] == 3 and x["hpqa_id"] not in hpqa_ids and not hpqa_ids.add(x["hpqa_id"])
]
random.Random(0).shuffle(hover)
trainset, devset, testset = hover[:100], hover[100:200], hover[650:]
import random
from dspy.datasets import DataLoader
kwargs = dict(fields=("claim", "supporting_facts", "hpqa_id", "num_hops"), input_keys=("claim",))
hover = DataLoader().from_huggingface(dataset_name="hover-nlp/hover", split="train", trust_remote_code=True, **kwargs)
hpqa_ids = set()
hover = [
    dspy.Example(claim=x.claim, titles=list(set([y["key"] for y in x.supporting_facts]))).with_inputs("claim")
    for x in hover
    if x["num_hops"] == 3 and x["hpqa_id"] not in hpqa_ids and not hpqa_ids.add(x["hpqa_id"])
]
random.Random(0).shuffle(hover)
trainset, devset, testset = hover[:100], hover[100:200], hover[650:]
Let's view an example of this task:
In [3]:
Copied!
example = trainset[0]
print("Claim:", example.claim)
print("Pages that must be retrieved:", example.titles)
example = trainset[0]
print("Claim:", example.claim)
print("Pages that must be retrieved:", example.titles)
Claim: This director is known for his work on Miss Potter. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presents the award in which he was nominated for his work in "Babe".
Pages that must be retrieved: ['Miss Potter', 'Chris Noonan', 'Academy Award for Best Director']
Now, let's define a function to do the search in Wikipedia. We'll rely on a ColBERTv2 server that can search the "abstracts" (i.e., first paragraphs) of every article that existed in Wikipedia in 2017, which is the data used in HoVer.
In [4]:
Copied!
DOCS = {}
def search(query: str, k: int) -> list[str]:
    results = dspy.ColBERTv2(url='http://20.102.90.50:2017/wiki17_abstracts')(query, k=k)
    results = [x['text'] for x in results]
    for result in results:
        title, text = result.split(" | ", 1)
        DOCS[title] = text
    return results
DOCS = {}
def search(query: str, k: int) -> list[str]:
    results = dspy.ColBERTv2(url='http://20.102.90.50:2017/wiki17_abstracts')(query, k=k)
    results = [x['text'] for x in results]
    for result in results:
        title, text = result.split(" | ", 1)
        DOCS[title] = text
    return results
Now, let's use the search function to define two tools for our ReAct agent:
In [5]:
Copied!
def search_wikipedia(query: str) -> list[str]:
    """Returns top-5 results and then the titles of the top-5 to top-30 results."""
    topK = search(query, 30)
    titles, topK = [f"`{x.split(' | ')[0]}`" for x in topK[5:30]], topK[:5]
    return topK + [f"Other retrieved pages have titles: {', '.join(titles)}."]
def lookup_wikipedia(title: str) -> str:
    """Returns the text of the Wikipedia page, if it exists."""
    if title in DOCS:
        return DOCS[title]
    results = [x for x in search(title, 10) if x.startswith(title + " | ")]
    if not results:
        return f"No Wikipedia page found for title: {title}"
    return results[0]
def search_wikipedia(query: str) -> list[str]:
    """Returns top-5 results and then the titles of the top-5 to top-30 results."""
    topK = search(query, 30)
    titles, topK = [f"`{x.split(' | ')[0]}`" for x in topK[5:30]], topK[:5]
    return topK + [f"Other retrieved pages have titles: {', '.join(titles)}."]
def lookup_wikipedia(title: str) -> str:
    """Returns the text of the Wikipedia page, if it exists."""
    if title in DOCS:
        return DOCS[title]
    results = [x for x in search(title, 10) if x.startswith(title + " | ")]
    if not results:
        return f"No Wikipedia page found for title: {title}"
    return results[0]
Now, let's define the ReAct agent in DSPy. It's going to be super simple: it'll take a claim and produce a list titles: list[str].
We'll instruct it to find all Wikipedia titles that are needed to fact-check the claim.
In [6]:
Copied!
instructions = "Find all Wikipedia titles relevant to verifying (or refuting) the claim."
signature = dspy.Signature("claim -> titles: list[str]", instructions)
react = dspy.ReAct(signature, tools=[search_wikipedia, lookup_wikipedia], max_iters=20)
instructions = "Find all Wikipedia titles relevant to verifying (or refuting) the claim."
signature = dspy.Signature("claim -> titles: list[str]", instructions)
react = dspy.ReAct(signature, tools=[search_wikipedia, lookup_wikipedia], max_iters=20)
Let's try it with a really simple claim to see if our tiny 3B model can do it!
In [7]:
Copied!
react(claim="David Gregory was born in 1625.").titles[:3]
react(claim="David Gregory was born in 1625.").titles[:3]
Out[7]:
['David Gregory (physician)', 'David A. Gregory', 'David Harry Gregory']
Great. Now let's set up an evaluation metric, top5_recall.
It will return the fraction of the gold pages (which are always 3) that are retrieved in the top-5 titles returned by the agent.
In [9]:
Copied!
def top5_recall(example, pred, trace=None):
    gold_titles = example.titles
    recall = sum(x in pred.titles[:5] for x in gold_titles) / len(gold_titles)
    # If we're "bootstrapping" for optimization, return True if and only if the recall is perfect.
    if trace is not None:
        return recall >= 1.0
    # If we're just doing inference, just measure the recall.
    return recall
evaluate = dspy.Evaluate(devset=devset, metric=top5_recall, num_threads=16, display_progress=True, display_table=5)
def top5_recall(example, pred, trace=None):
    gold_titles = example.titles
    recall = sum(x in pred.titles[:5] for x in gold_titles) / len(gold_titles)
    # If we're "bootstrapping" for optimization, return True if and only if the recall is perfect.
    if trace is not None:
        return recall >= 1.0
    # If we're just doing inference, just measure the recall.
    return recall
evaluate = dspy.Evaluate(devset=devset, metric=top5_recall, num_threads=16, display_progress=True, display_table=5)
Let's evaluate our off-the-shelf agent, with Llama-3.2-8B, to see how far we can go already.
This model is tiny, so it can complain fairly often. Let's wrap it in a try/except block to hide those.
In [10]:

Wow. It only scores 8% in terms of recall. Not that good!

Awesome. It looks like the system improved drastically from 8% recall to around 40% recall. That was a pretty straightforward approach, but DSPy gives you many tools to continue iterating on this from here.
Next, let's inspect the optimized prompts to understand what it has learned. We'll run one query and then inspect the last two prompts, which will show us the prompts used for both ReAct sub-modules, the one that does the agentic loop and the other than prepares the final results.

The better known of the two, "Amaryllis belladonna", is a native of the Western Cape region of South Africa, particularly the rocky southwest area between the Olifants River Valley to Knysna. For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names "Amaryllis" and "Hippeastrum", one result of which is that the common name "amaryllis" is mainly used for cultivars of the genus "Hippeastrum", widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors. Plants of the genus "Amaryllis" are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March. This is one of numerous genera with the common name "lily" due to their flower shape and growth habit. However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, "Lilium".»

The adjective "Ortonesque" is sometimes used to refer to work characterised by a similarly dark yet farcical cynicism.
[[ ## thought_3 ## ]]
I have identified both playwrights as Bernard-Marie Koltès and Joe Orton, who both wrote the unproduced script for "Up Against It".

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## titles ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python list[str]), and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
Response:
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
The claim states that the authors of the unproduced script for "Up Against It" are both playwrights. Investigation revealed that Bernard-Marie Koltès wrote the unproduced script, and further research confirmed that Joe Orton was also a playwright who wrote the script. Therefore, both playwrights are indeed the authors of the unproduced script for "Up Against It".

Finally, let's save our optimized program so we can use it again later.

In this tutorial, we'll use an extremely small LM, Meta's Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct which has 3 billion parameters.
A model like this is not very reliable out of the box for long or complex agent loops. However, it's extremely fast and cheap to host, as it needs very little RAM.
You might be able to host the 3B model on your laptop with Ollama, on your GPU server with SGLang, or via a provider that hosts it for you like Databricks or Together.
In the snippet below, we'll configure our main LM as Llama-3.2-3B. We'll also set up a larger LM, i.e. GPT-4o, as a teacher that we'll invoke a very small number of times to help teach the small LM.

Let's now optimize the two prompts inside dspy.ReAct jointly to maximize the recall of our agent. This may take around 30 minutes and make some $5 worth of calls to GPT-4o to optimize Llama-3.2-3B.

The better known of the two, "Amaryllis belladonna", is a native of the Western Cape region of South Africa, particularly the rocky southwest area between the Olifants River Valley to Knysna. For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names "Amaryllis" and "Hippeastrum", one result of which is that the common name "amaryllis" is mainly used for cultivars of the genus "Hippeastrum", widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors. Plants of the genus "Amaryllis" are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March. This is one of numerous genera with the common name "lily" due to their flower shape and growth habit. However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, "Lilium".»

John Kingsley "Joe" Orton (1 January 1933 – 9 August 1967) was an English playwright and author. His public career was short but prolific, lasting from 1964 until his death three years later. During this brief period he shocked, outraged, and amused audiences with his scandalous black comedies. The adjective "Ortonesque" is sometimes used to refer to work characterised by a similarly dark yet farcical cynicism.

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
The claim states that the authors of the unproduced script for "Up Against It" are both playwrights. Investigation revealed that Bernard-Marie Koltès wrote the unproduced script, and further research confirmed that Joe Orton was also a playwright who wrote the script. Therefore, both playwrights are indeed the authors of the unproduced script for "Up Against It".

John Kingsley "Joe" Orton (1 January 1933 – 9 August 1967) was an English playwright and author. His public career was short but prolific, lasting from 1964 until his death three years later. During this brief period he shocked, outraged, and amused audiences with his scandalous black comedies. The adjective "Ortonesque" is sometimes used to refer to work characterised by a similarly dark yet farcical cynicism.

The better known of the two, "Amaryllis belladonna", is a native of the Western Cape region of South Africa, particularly the rocky southwest area between the Olifants River Valley to Knysna. For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names "Amaryllis" and "Hippeastrum", one result of which is that the common name "amaryllis" is mainly used for cultivars of the genus "Hippeastrum", widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors. Plants of the genus "Amaryllis" are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March.

For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names "Amaryllis" and "Hippeastrum", one result of which is that the common name "amaryllis" is mainly used for cultivars of the genus "Hippeastrum", widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors. Plants of the genus "Amaryllis" are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March. This is one of numerous genera with the common name "lily" due to their flower shape and growth habit. However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, "Lilium".»

The search results do not definitively confirm "Chengiopanax" as a genus, rather they focus on the species "Chengiopanax sciadophylloides" which was previously part of the "Eleutherococcus" genus. There is no clear indication in the search results that "Chengiopanax" is recognized as a genus.

Chengiopanax sciadophylloides is a flowering tree in the family Araliaceae native to Japan. Previously included in the genus "Eleutherococcus", it is distinguished from other members of that genus by not having spines or prickles and ITS sequence data confirmed the separation.

The lookup did not provide any new information suggesting that "Chengiopanax" is a genus. It seems that "Chengiopanax sciadophylloides" is a species and not a genus.

The claim states that both "Chengiopanax sciadophylloides" and "Amaryllis" are genus. Upon investigation, it was found that "Chengiopanax sciadophylloides" is a species of flowering tree, and there is no confirmation that "Chengiopanax" itself is a recognized genus. It was previously included in the genus "Eleutherococcus". On the other hand, "Amaryllis" is confirmed to be a genus, specifically a small genus of flowering bulbs with two species. Therefore, the claim is only partially correct as "Chengiopanax sciadophylloides" is not a genus.

[2] «Amaryllis | Amaryllis ( ) is the only genus in the subtribe Amaryllidinae (tribe Amaryllideae). It is a small genus of flowering bulbs, with two species. The better known of the two, "Amaryllis belladonna", is a native of the Western Cape region of South Africa, particularly the rocky southwest area between the Olifants River Valley to Knysna. For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names "Amaryllis" and "Hippeastrum", one result of which is that the common name "amaryllis" is mainly used for cultivars of the genus "Hippeastrum", widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors. Plants of the genus "Amaryllis" are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March. This is one of numerous genera with the common name "lily" due to their flower shape and growth habit. However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, "Lilium".»

The family takes its name from the genus "Amaryllis" and is commonly known as the amaryllis family. The leaves are usually linear, and the flowers are usually bisexual and symmetrical, arranged in umbels on the stem. The petals and sepals are undifferentiated as tepals, which may be fused at the base into a floral tube. Some also display a corona.

The claim suggests that the 1990 film which "Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi" is loosely based on stars an actor known for martial arts action films. Upon investigation, "Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi" is indeed loosely based on the Hollywood film "Lionheart". The 1990 film "Lionheart" stars Jean-Claude Van Damme, who is recognized for his roles in martial arts action films. This information supports the claim.

[2] «Amaryllis | Amaryllis ( ) is the only genus in the subtribe Amaryllidinae (tribe Amaryllideae). It is a small genus of flowering bulbs, with two species. The better known of the two, "Amaryllis belladonna", is a native of the Western Cape region of South Africa, particularly the rocky southwest area between the Olifants River Valley to Knysna. For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names "Amaryllis" and "Hippeastrum", one result of which is that the common name "amaryllis" is mainly used for cultivars of the genus "Hippeastrum", widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors. Plants of the genus "Amaryllis" are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March. This is one of numerous genera with the common name "lily" due to their flower shape and growth habit. However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, "Lilium".»

The better known of the two, "Amaryllis belladonna", is a native of the Western Cape region of South Africa, particularly the rocky southwest area between the Olifants River Valley to Knysna. For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names "Amaryllis" and "Hippeastrum", one result of which is that the common name "amaryllis" is mainly used for cultivars of the genus "Hippeastrum", widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors. Plants of the genus "Amaryllis" are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March. This is one of numerous genera with the common name "lily" due to their flower shape and growth habit. However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, "Lilium".»

John Kingsley "Joe" Orton (1 January 1933 – 9 August 1967) was an English playwright and author. His public career was short but prolific, lasting from 1964 until his death three years later. During this brief period he shocked, outraged, and amused audiences with his scandalous black comedies. The adjective "Ortonesque" is sometimes used to refer to work characterised by a similarly dark yet farcical cynicism.

Response:
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
The claim states that the authors of the unproduced script for "Up Against It" are both playwrights. Investigation revealed that Bernard-Marie Koltès wrote the unproduced script, and further research confirmed that Joe Orton was also a playwright who wrote the script. Therefore, both playwrights are indeed the authors of the unproduced script for "Up Against It".

### Tutorial: Deploying your DSPy program
This guide demonstrates two potential ways to deploy your DSPy program in production: FastAPI for lightweight deployments and MLflow for more production-grade deployments with program versioning and management.
Below, we'll assume you have the following simple DSPy program that you want to deploy. You can replace this with something more sophisticated.
```python
import dspy
dspy.settings.configure(lm=dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini"))
dspy_program = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer")
```
import dspy
dspy.settings.configure(lm=dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini"))
dspy_program = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer")
## Deploying with FastAPI
FastAPI offers a straightforward way to serve your DSPy program as a REST API. This is ideal when you have direct access to your program code and need a lightweight deployment solution.
```python
> pip install fastapi uvicorn
> export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```
> pip install fastapi uvicorn
> export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
Let's create a FastAPI application to serve your dspy_program defined above.
`dspy_program`
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import dspy
app = FastAPI(
    title="DSPy Program API",
    description="A simple API serving a DSPy Chain of Thought program",
    version="1.0.0"
)
# Define request model for better documentation and validation
class Question(BaseModel):
    text: str
# Configure your language model and 'asyncify' your DSPy program.
lm = dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini")
dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm, async_max_workers=4) # default is 8
dspy_program = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer")
dspy_program = dspy.asyncify(dspy_program)
@app.post("/predict")
async def predict(question: Question):
    try:
        result = await dspy_program(question=question.text)
        return {
            "status": "success",
            "data": result.toDict()
        }
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import dspy
app = FastAPI(
    title="DSPy Program API",
    description="A simple API serving a DSPy Chain of Thought program",
    version="1.0.0"
)
# Define request model for better documentation and validation
class Question(BaseModel):
    text: str
# Configure your language model and 'asyncify' your DSPy program.
lm = dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini")
dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm, async_max_workers=4) # default is 8
dspy_program = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer")
dspy_program = dspy.asyncify(dspy_program)
@app.post("/predict")
async def predict(question: Question):
    try:
        result = await dspy_program(question=question.text)
        return {
            "status": "success",
            "data": result.toDict()
        }
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
In the code above, we call dspy.asyncify to convert the dspy program to run in async mode for high-throughput FastAPI
deployments. Currently, this runs the dspy program in a separate thread and awaits its result.
`dspy.asyncify`
By default, the limit of spawned threads is 8. Think of this like a worker pool.
If you have 8 in-flight programs and call it once more, the 9th call will wait until one of the 8 returns.
You can configure the async capacity using the new async_max_workers setting.
`async_max_workers`
Streaming is also supported in DSPy 2.6.0+, available as a release candidate via pip install -U --pre dspy.
`pip install -U --pre dspy`
We can use dspy.streamify to convert the dspy program to a streaming mode. This is useful when you want to stream
the intermediate outputs (i.e. O1-style reasoning) to the client before the final prediction is ready. This uses
asyncify under the hood and inherits the execution semantics.
`dspy.streamify`
```python
dspy_program = dspy.asyncify(dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer"))
streaming_dspy_program = dspy.streamify(dspy_program)
@app.post("/predict/stream")
async def stream(question: Question):
    async def generate():
        async for value in streaming_dspy_program(question=question.text):
            if isinstance(value, dspy.Prediction):
                data = {"prediction": value.labels().toDict()}
            elif isinstance(value, litellm.ModelResponse):
                data = {"chunk": value.json()}
            yield f"data: {ujson.dumps(data)}\n\n"
        yield "data: [DONE]\n\n"
    return StreamingResponse(generate(), media_type="text/event-stream")
# Since you're often going to want to stream the result of a DSPy program as server-sent events,
# we've included a helper function for that, which is equivalent to the code above.
from dspy.utils.streaming import streaming_response
@app.post("/predict/stream")
async def stream(question: Question):
    stream = streaming_dspy_program(question=question.text)
    return StreamingResponse(streaming_response(stream), media_type="text/event-stream")
```
dspy_program = dspy.asyncify(dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer"))
streaming_dspy_program = dspy.streamify(dspy_program)
@app.post("/predict/stream")
async def stream(question: Question):
    async def generate():
        async for value in streaming_dspy_program(question=question.text):
            if isinstance(value, dspy.Prediction):
                data = {"prediction": value.labels().toDict()}
            elif isinstance(value, litellm.ModelResponse):
                data = {"chunk": value.json()}
            yield f"data: {ujson.dumps(data)}\n\n"
        yield "data: [DONE]\n\n"
    return StreamingResponse(generate(), media_type="text/event-stream")
# Since you're often going to want to stream the result of a DSPy program as server-sent events,
# we've included a helper function for that, which is equivalent to the code above.
from dspy.utils.streaming import streaming_response
@app.post("/predict/stream")
async def stream(question: Question):
    stream = streaming_dspy_program(question=question.text)
    return StreamingResponse(streaming_response(stream), media_type="text/event-stream")
Write your code to a file, e.g., fastapi_dspy.py. Then you can serve the app with:
`fastapi_dspy.py`
```python
> uvicorn fastapi_dspy:app --reload
```
> uvicorn fastapi_dspy:app --reload
It will start a local server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. You can test it with the python code below:
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
```python
import requests
response = requests.post(
    "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict",
    json={"text": "What is the capital of France?"}
)
print(response.json())
```
import requests
response = requests.post(
    "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict",
    json={"text": "What is the capital of France?"}
)
print(response.json())
You should see the response like below:
```python
{'status': 'success', 'data': {'reasoning': 'The capital of France is a well-known fact, commonly taught in geography classes and referenced in various contexts. Paris is recognized globally as the capital city, serving as the political, cultural, and economic center of the country.', 'answer': 'The capital of France is Paris.'}}
```
{'status': 'success', 'data': {'reasoning': 'The capital of France is a well-known fact, commonly taught in geography classes and referenced in various contexts. Paris is recognized globally as the capital city, serving as the political, cultural, and economic center of the country.', 'answer': 'The capital of France is Paris.'}}
## Deploying with MLflow
We recommend deploying with MLflow if you are looking to package your DSPy program and deploy in an isolated environment.
MLflow is a popular platform for managing machine learning workflows, including versioning, tracking, and deployment.
```python
> pip install mlflow>=2.18.0
```
> pip install mlflow>=2.18.0
Let's spin up the MLflow tracking server, where we will store our DSPy program. The command below will start a local server at
http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
```python
> mlflow ui
```
> mlflow ui
Then we can define the DSPy program and log it to the MLflow server. "log" is an overloaded term in MLflow, basically it means
we store the program information along with environment requirements in the MLflow server. See the code below:
```python
import dspy
import mlflow
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://127.0.0.1:5000/")
mlflow.set_experiment("deploy_dspy_program")
lm = dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini")
dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm)
dspy_program = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer")
with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.dspy.log_model(
        dspy_program,
        "dspy_program",
        input_example={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is LLM agent?"}]},
        task="llm/v1/chat",
    )
```
import dspy
import mlflow
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://127.0.0.1:5000/")
mlflow.set_experiment("deploy_dspy_program")
lm = dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini")
dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm)
dspy_program = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer")
with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.dspy.log_model(
        dspy_program,
        "dspy_program",
        input_example={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is LLM agent?"}]},
        task="llm/v1/chat",
    )
We recommend you to set task="llm/v1/chat" so that the deployed program automatically takes input and generate output in
the same format as the OpenAI chat API, which is a common interface for LM applications. Write the code above into
a file, e.g. mlflow_dspy.py, and run it.
`task="llm/v1/chat"`
`mlflow_dspy.py`
After you logged the program, you can view the saved information in MLflow UI. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and select
the deploy_dspy_program experiment, then select the run your just created, under the Artifacts tab, you should see the
logged program information, similar to the following screenshot:
`deploy_dspy_program`
`Artifacts`
Grab your run id from UI (or the console print when you execute mlflow_dspy.py), now you can deploy the logged program
with the following command:
```python
> mlflow models serve -m runs:/{run_id}/model -p 6000
```
> mlflow models serve -m runs:/{run_id}/model -p 6000
After the program is deployed, you can test it with the following command:
```python
> curl http://127.0.0.1:6000/invocations -H "Content-Type:application/json"  --data '{"messages": [{"content": "what is 2 + 2?", "role": "user"}]}'
```
> curl http://127.0.0.1:6000/invocations -H "Content-Type:application/json"  --data '{"messages": [{"content": "what is 2 + 2?", "role": "user"}]}'
You should see the response like below:
```python
{"choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The question asks for the sum of 2 and 2. To find the answer, we simply add the two numbers together: 2 + 2 = 4.\", \"answer\": \"4\"}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}]}
```
{"choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The question asks for the sum of 2 and 2. To find the answer, we simply add the two numbers together: 2 + 2 = 4.\", \"answer\": \"4\"}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}]}
For complete guide on how to deploy a DSPy program with MLflow, and how to customize the deployment, please refer to the
MLflow documentation.
### Best Practices for MLflow Deployment
- Environment Management: Always specify your Python dependencies in a conda.yaml or requirements.txt file.
- Versioning: Use meaningful tags and descriptions for your model versions.
- Input Validation: Define clear input schemas and examples.
- Monitoring: Set up proper logging and monitoring for production deployments.
`conda.yaml`
`requirements.txt`
For production deployments, consider using MLflow with containerization:
```python
> mlflow models build-docker -m "runs:/{run_id}/model" -n "dspy-program"
> docker run -p 6000:8080 dspy-program
```
> mlflow models build-docker -m "runs:/{run_id}/model" -n "dspy-program"
> docker run -p 6000:8080 dspy-program
For a complete guide on production deployment options and best practices, refer to the
MLflow documentation.

### Tutorial: Entity Extraction¶
Tutorial: Entity Extraction¶This tutorial demonstrates how to perform entity extraction using the CoNLL-2003 dataset with DSPy. The focus is on extracting entities referring to people. We will:
Extract and label entities from the CoNLL-2003 dataset that refer to people
Define a DSPy program for extracting entities that refer to people
Optimize and evaluate the program on a subset of the CoNLL-2003 dataset
By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to structure tasks in DSPy using signatures and modules, evaluate your system's performance, and improve its quality with optimizers.
Install the latest version of DSPy and follow along. If you're looking instead for a conceptual overview of DSPy, this recent lecture is a good place to start.

Load and Prepare the Dataset¶In this section, we prepare the CoNLL-2003 dataset, which is commonly used for entity extraction tasks. The dataset includes tokens annotated with entity labels such as persons, organizations, and locations.
We will:
Load the dataset using the Hugging Face datasets library.
Define a function to extract tokens referring to people.
Slice the dataset to create smaller subsets for training and testing.
DSPy expects examples in a structured format, so we'll also transform the dataset into DSPy Examples for easy integration.

Configure DSPy and create an Entity Extraction Program¶Here, we define a DSPy program for extracting entities referring to people from tokenized text.
Then, we configure DSPy to use a particular language model (gpt-4o-mini) for all invocations of the program.
Key DSPy Concepts Introduced:
Signatures: Define structured input/output schemas for your program.
Modules: Encapsulate program logic in reusable, composable units.
Specifically, we'll:
Create a PeopleExtraction DSPy Signature to specify the input (tokens) and output (extracted_people) fields.
Define a people_extractor program that uses DSPy's built-in dspy.ChainOfThought module to implement the PeopleExtraction signature. The program extracts entities referring to people from a list of input tokens using language model (LM) prompting.
Use the dspy.LM class and dspy.settings.configure() method to configure the language model that DSPy will use when invoking the program.
In [3]:
Copied!
from typing import List
class PeopleExtraction(dspy.Signature):
    """
    Extract contiguous tokens referring to specific people, if any, from a list of string tokens.
    Output a list of tokens. In other words, do not combine multiple tokens into a single value.
    """
    tokens: list[str] = dspy.InputField(desc="tokenized text")
    extracted_people: list[str] = dspy.OutputField(desc="all tokens referring to specific people extracted from the tokenized text")
people_extractor = dspy.ChainOfThought(PeopleExtraction)
from typing import List
class PeopleExtraction(dspy.Signature):
    """
    Extract contiguous tokens referring to specific people, if any, from a list of string tokens.
    Output a list of tokens. In other words, do not combine multiple tokens into a single value.
    """
    tokens: list[str] = dspy.InputField(desc="tokenized text")
    extracted_people: list[str] = dspy.OutputField(desc="all tokens referring to specific people extracted from the tokenized text")
people_extractor = dspy.ChainOfThought(PeopleExtraction)
Here, we tell DSPy to use OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini model in our program. To authenticate, DSPy reads your OPENAI_API_KEY. You can easily swap this out for other providers or local models.
In [4]:
Copied!
lm = dspy.LM(model="openai/gpt-4o-mini")
dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm)
lm = dspy.LM(model="openai/gpt-4o-mini")
dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm)
Define Metric and Evaluation Functions¶In DSPy, evaluating a program's performance is critical for iterative development. A good evaluation framework allows us to:
Measure the quality of our program's outputs.
Compare outputs against ground-truth labels.
Identify areas for improvement.
What We'll Do:
Define a custom metric (extraction_correctness_metric) to evaluate whether the extracted entities match the ground truth.
Create an evaluation function (evaluate_correctness) to apply this metric to a training or test dataset and compute the overall accuracy.
The evaluation function uses DSPy's Evaluate utility to handle parallelism and visualization of results.
In [5]:

def extraction_correctness_metric(example: dspy.Example, prediction: dspy.Prediction, trace=None) -> bool:

    metric=extraction_correctness_metric,
    num_threads=24,
    display_progress=True,
    display_table=True
)
Evaluate Initial Extractor¶Before optimizing our program, we need a baseline evaluation to understand its current performance. This helps us:
Establish a reference point for comparison after optimization.
Identify potential weaknesses in the initial implementation.
In this step, we'll run our people_extractor program on the test set and measure its accuracy using the evaluation framework defined earlier.

Optimize the Model¶DSPy includes powerful optimizers that can improve the quality of your system.
Here, we use DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer to:
Automatically tune the program's language model (LM) prompt by 1. using the LM to adjust the prompt's instructions and 2. building few-shot examples from the training dataset that are augmented with reasoning generated from dspy.ChainOfThought.
Maximize correctness on the training set.
This optimization process is automated, saving time and effort while improving accuracy.

Validate that the program generalizes well to unseen data.
In this case, we see that accuracy of the program on the test dataset has improved significantly.

Use inspect_history(n=1) to view the last interaction and analyze the generated prompt.

Saving and Loading Optimized Programs¶DSPy supports saving and loading programs, enabling you to reuse optimized systems without the need to re-optimize from scratch. This feature is especially useful for deploying your programs in production environments or sharing them with collaborators.
In this step, we'll save the optimized program to a file and demonstrate how to load it back for future use.

Conclusion¶In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to:
Use DSPy to build a modular, interpretable system for entity extraction.
Evaluate and optimize the system using DSPy's built-in tools.
By leveraging structured inputs and outputs, we ensured that the system was easy to understand and improve. The optimization process allowed us to quickly improve performance without manually crafting prompts or tweaking parameters.
Next Steps:
Experiment with extraction of other entity types (e.g., locations or organizations).
Explore DSPy's other builtin modules like ReAct for more complex reasoning tasks.
Use the system in larger workflows, such as large scale document processing or summarization.
Tutorial: Entity Extraction¶This tutorial demonstrates how to perform entity extraction using the CoNLL-2003 dataset with DSPy. The focus is on extracting entities referring to people. We will:
Extract and label entities from the CoNLL-2003 dataset that refer to people
Define a DSPy program for extracting entities that refer to people
Optimize and evaluate the program on a subset of the CoNLL-2003 dataset
By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to structure tasks in DSPy using signatures and modules, evaluate your system's performance, and improve its quality with optimizers.
Install the latest version of DSPy and follow along. If you're looking instead for a conceptual overview of DSPy, this recent lecture is a good place to start.

Load and Prepare the Dataset¶In this section, we prepare the CoNLL-2003 dataset, which is commonly used for entity extraction tasks. The dataset includes tokens annotated with entity labels such as persons, organizations, and locations.
We will:
Load the dataset using the Hugging Face datasets library.
Define a function to extract tokens referring to people.
Slice the dataset to create smaller subsets for training and testing.
DSPy expects examples in a structured format, so we'll also transform the dataset into DSPy Examples for easy integration.

Configure DSPy and create an Entity Extraction Program¶Here, we define a DSPy program for extracting entities referring to people from tokenized text.
Then, we configure DSPy to use a particular language model (gpt-4o-mini) for all invocations of the program.
Key DSPy Concepts Introduced:
Signatures: Define structured input/output schemas for your program.
Modules: Encapsulate program logic in reusable, composable units.
Specifically, we'll:
Create a PeopleExtraction DSPy Signature to specify the input (tokens) and output (extracted_people) fields.
Define a people_extractor program that uses DSPy's built-in dspy.ChainOfThought module to implement the PeopleExtraction signature. The program extracts entities referring to people from a list of input tokens using language model (LM) prompting.
Use the dspy.LM class and dspy.settings.configure() method to configure the language model that DSPy will use when invoking the program.
In [3]:
Copied!
from typing import List
class PeopleExtraction(dspy.Signature):
    """
    Extract contiguous tokens referring to specific people, if any, from a list of string tokens.
    Output a list of tokens. In other words, do not combine multiple tokens into a single value.
    """
    tokens: list[str] = dspy.InputField(desc="tokenized text")
    extracted_people: list[str] = dspy.OutputField(desc="all tokens referring to specific people extracted from the tokenized text")
people_extractor = dspy.ChainOfThought(PeopleExtraction)
from typing import List
class PeopleExtraction(dspy.Signature):
    """
    Extract contiguous tokens referring to specific people, if any, from a list of string tokens.
    Output a list of tokens. In other words, do not combine multiple tokens into a single value.
    """
    tokens: list[str] = dspy.InputField(desc="tokenized text")
    extracted_people: list[str] = dspy.OutputField(desc="all tokens referring to specific people extracted from the tokenized text")
people_extractor = dspy.ChainOfThought(PeopleExtraction)
Here, we tell DSPy to use OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini model in our program. To authenticate, DSPy reads your OPENAI_API_KEY. You can easily swap this out for other providers or local models.
In [4]:

lm = dspy.LM(model="openai/gpt-4o-mini")
dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm)
lm = dspy.LM(model="openai/gpt-4o-mini")
dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm)
Define Metric and Evaluation Functions¶In DSPy, evaluating a program's performance is critical for iterative development. A good evaluation framework allows us to:
Measure the quality of our program's outputs.
Compare outputs against ground-truth labels.
Identify areas for improvement.
What We'll Do:
Define a custom metric (extraction_correctness_metric) to evaluate whether the extracted entities match the ground truth.
Create an evaluation function (evaluate_correctness) to apply this metric to a training or test dataset and compute the overall accuracy.
The evaluation function uses DSPy's Evaluate utility to handle parallelism and visualization of results.
In [5]:

def extraction_correctness_metric(example: dspy.Example, prediction: dspy.Prediction, trace=None) -> bool:

    metric=extraction_correctness_metric,
    num_threads=24,
    display_progress=True,
    display_table=True
)
Evaluate Initial Extractor¶Before optimizing our program, we need a baseline evaluation to understand its current performance. This helps us:
Establish a reference point for comparison after optimization.
Identify potential weaknesses in the initial implementation.
In this step, we'll run our people_extractor program on the test set and measure its accuracy using the evaluation framework defined earlier.

Optimize the Model¶DSPy includes powerful optimizers that can improve the quality of your system.
Here, we use DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer to:
Automatically tune the program's language model (LM) prompt by 1. using the LM to adjust the prompt's instructions and 2. building few-shot examples from the training dataset that are augmented with reasoning generated from dspy.ChainOfThought.
Maximize correctness on the training set.
This optimization process is automated, saving time and effort while improving accuracy.

Evaluate Optimized Program¶After optimization, we re-evaluate the program on the test set to measure improvements. Comparing the optimized and initial results allows us to:
Quantify the benefits of optimization.
Validate that the program generalizes well to unseen data.
In this case, we see that accuracy of the program on the test dataset has improved significantly.

Use inspect_history(n=1) to view the last interaction and analyze the generated prompt.

Conclusion¶In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to:
Use DSPy to build a modular, interpretable system for entity extraction.
Evaluate and optimize the system using DSPy's built-in tools.
By leveraging structured inputs and outputs, we ensured that the system was easy to understand and improve. The optimization process allowed us to quickly improve performance without manually crafting prompts or tweaking parameters.
Next Steps:
Experiment with extraction of other entity types (e.g., locations or organizations).
Explore DSPy's other builtin modules like ReAct for more complex reasoning tasks.
Use the system in larger workflows, such as large scale document processing or summarization.

Load and Prepare the Dataset¶In this section, we prepare the CoNLL-2003 dataset, which is commonly used for entity extraction tasks. The dataset includes tokens annotated with entity labels such as persons, organizations, and locations.
We will:
Load the dataset using the Hugging Face datasets library.
Define a function to extract tokens referring to people.
Slice the dataset to create smaller subsets for training and testing.
DSPy expects examples in a structured format, so we'll also transform the dataset into DSPy Examples for easy integration.

Configure DSPy and create an Entity Extraction Program¶Here, we define a DSPy program for extracting entities referring to people from tokenized text.
Then, we configure DSPy to use a particular language model (gpt-4o-mini) for all invocations of the program.
Key DSPy Concepts Introduced:
Signatures: Define structured input/output schemas for your program.
Modules: Encapsulate program logic in reusable, composable units.
Specifically, we'll:
Create a PeopleExtraction DSPy Signature to specify the input (tokens) and output (extracted_people) fields.
Define a people_extractor program that uses DSPy's built-in dspy.ChainOfThought module to implement the PeopleExtraction signature. The program extracts entities referring to people from a list of input tokens using language model (LM) prompting.
Use the dspy.LM class and dspy.settings.configure() method to configure the language model that DSPy will use when invoking the program.

Define Metric and Evaluation Functions¶In DSPy, evaluating a program's performance is critical for iterative development. A good evaluation framework allows us to:
Measure the quality of our program's outputs.
Compare outputs against ground-truth labels.
Identify areas for improvement.
What We'll Do:
Define a custom metric (extraction_correctness_metric) to evaluate whether the extracted entities match the ground truth.

The evaluation function uses DSPy's Evaluate utility to handle parallelism and visualization of results.
Define Metric and Evaluation Functions¶In DSPy, evaluating a program's performance is critical for iterative development. A good evaluation framework allows us to:
Measure the quality of our program's outputs.
Compare outputs against ground-truth labels.
Identify areas for improvement.
What We'll Do:
Define a custom metric (extraction_correctness_metric) to evaluate whether the extracted entities match the ground truth.

Evaluate Initial Extractor¶Before optimizing our program, we need a baseline evaluation to understand its current performance. This helps us:
Establish a reference point for comparison after optimization.
Identify potential weaknesses in the initial implementation.
In this step, we'll run our people_extractor program on the test set and measure its accuracy using the evaluation framework defined earlier.

Evaluate Optimized Program¶After optimization, we re-evaluate the program on the test set to measure improvements. Comparing the optimized and initial results allows us to:
Quantify the benefits of optimization.
Validate that the program generalizes well to unseen data.
In this case, we see that accuracy of the program on the test dataset has improved significantly.

Inspect Optimized Program's Prompt¶After optimizing the program, we can inspect the history of interactions to see how DSPy has augmented the program's prompt with few-shot examples. This step demonstrates:
The structure of the prompt used by the program.
How few-shot examples are added to guide the model's behavior.
Use inspect_history(n=1) to view the last interaction and analyze the generated prompt.

Conclusion¶In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to:
Use DSPy to build a modular, interpretable system for entity extraction.
Evaluate and optimize the system using DSPy's built-in tools.
By leveraging structured inputs and outputs, we ensured that the system was easy to understand and improve. The optimization process allowed us to quickly improve performance without manually crafting prompts or tweaking parameters.
Next Steps:
Experiment with extraction of other entity types (e.g., locations or organizations).
Explore DSPy's other builtin modules like ReAct for more complex reasoning tasks.
Use the system in larger workflows, such as large scale document processing or summarization.

### Tutorial: Math Reasoning¶
Tutorial: Math Reasoning¶Let's walk through a quick example of setting up a dspy.ChainOfThought module and optimizing it for answering algebra questions.
Install the latest DSPy via pip install -U dspy and follow along.
Let's tell DSPy that we will use OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini in our modules. To authenticate, DSPy will look into your OPENAI_API_KEY. You can easily swap this out for other providers or local models.
In [1]:
Copied!
import dspy
gpt4o_mini = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini', max_tokens=2000)
gpt4o = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o', max_tokens=2000)
dspy.configure(lm=gpt4o_mini)  # we'll use gpt-4o-mini as the default LM, unless otherwise specified
import dspy
gpt4o_mini = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini', max_tokens=2000)
gpt4o = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o', max_tokens=2000)
dspy.configure(lm=gpt4o_mini)  # we'll use gpt-4o-mini as the default LM, unless otherwise specified
Next, let's load some data examples from the MATH benchmark. We'll use a training split for optimization and evaluate it on a held-out dev set.
Please note that the following step will require:
%pip install git+https://github.com/hendrycks/math.git
In [2]:
Copied!
from dspy.datasets import MATH
dataset = MATH(subset='algebra')
print(len(dataset.train), len(dataset.dev))
from dspy.datasets import MATH
dataset = MATH(subset='algebra')
print(len(dataset.train), len(dataset.dev))
350 350
Let's inspect one example from the training set.
In [3]:
Copied!
example = dataset.train[0]
print("Question:", example.question)
print("Answer:", example.answer)
example = dataset.train[0]
print("Question:", example.question)
print("Answer:", example.answer)
Question: The doctor has told Cal O'Ree that during his ten weeks of working out at the gym, he can expect each week's weight loss to be $1\%$ of his weight at the end of the previous week. His weight at the beginning of the workouts is $244$ pounds. How many pounds does he expect to weigh at the end of the ten weeks? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.
Answer: 221
Now let's define our module. It's extremely simple: just a chain-of-thought step that takes a question and produces an answer.
In [4]:
Copied!
module = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer")
module(question=example.question)
module = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer")
module(question=example.question)
Out[4]:
Prediction(
    reasoning="Cal O'Ree's weight loss each week is $1\\%$ of his weight at the end of the previous week. This means that at the end of each week, he retains $99\\%$ of his weight from the previous week. \n\nIf we denote his weight at the beginning as \\( W_0 = 244 \\) pounds, then his weight at the end of week \\( n \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[\nW_n = W_{n-1} \\times 0.99\n\\]\nThis can be simplified to:\n\\[\nW_n = W_0 \\times (0.99)^n\n\\]\nAfter 10 weeks, his weight will be:\n\\[\nW_{10} = 244 \\times (0.99)^{10}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate \\( (0.99)^{10} \\):\n\\[\n(0.99)^{10} \\approx 0.904382\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate his expected weight after 10 weeks:\n\\[\nW_{10} \\approx 244 \\times 0.904382 \\approx 220.5\n\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, Cal O'Ree can expect to weigh approximately \\( 221 \\) pounds at the end of the ten weeks.",
    answer='221'

And lastly let's optimize our module. Since we want strong reasoning, we'll use the large GPT-4o as the teacher model (used to bootstrap reasoning for the small LM at optimization time) but not as the prompt model (used to craft instructions) or the task model (trained).
GPT-4o will be invoked only a small number of times. The model involved directly in optimization and in the resulting (optimized) program will be GPT-4o-mini.
We will also specify max_bootstrapped_demos=4 which means we want at most four bootstrapped examples in the prompt and max_labeled_demos=4 which means that, in total between bootstrapped and pre-labeled examples, we want at most four.

The equation $|4x+2|=10$ implies two possible equations: $4x+2=10$ or $4x+2=-10$. We solve each equation separately.
1. For $4x+2=10$:
   \[
   4x + 2 = 10 \\
   4x = 8 \\
   x = 2
   \]
   However, $x=2$ does not satisfy the condition $x<0$.
2. For $4x+2=-10$:
   \[
   4x + 2 = -10 \\
   4x = -12 \\
   x = -3
   \]
   The solution $x = -3$ satisfies the condition $x<0$.
Therefore, the value of $x$ is $\boxed{-3}$.

The product of the roots of this quadratic is $-36/1=-36$, so the other solution must be $-36/-4=9$. That means that the sum of the solutions is $-4+9=5$. The sum of the solutions is also $-b/1=-b$. Thus, $-b=5$ and $b=\boxed{-5}$.

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## answer ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
Assistant message:
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
Let the length of the playground be $l$ and the width be $w$. We have the equation $2l+2w=200 \Rightarrow l + w = 100$. We want to maximize the area of this rectangular playground, which is given by $lw$. From our equation, we know that $l=100-w$. Substituting this in to our expression for area, we have \[(100-w)(w)=100w-w^2\]We will now complete the square to find the maximum value of this expression. Factoring a $-1$ out, we have \[-(w^2-100w)\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(100/2)^2=2500$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we get \[-(w^2-100w+2500-2500) \Rightarrow -(w-50)^2+2500\]Since the maximum value of $-(w-50)^2$ is 0 (perfect squares are always nonnegative), the maximum value of the entire expression is 2500, which is achieved when $w=50$ and $l=100-w=50$ (the playground is a square). Thus, the maximum area of the playground is $\boxed{2500}$ square feet.

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Alice starts first. On Alice's turn, she flips a coin. If she gets a heads, she wins. If not, it becomes Bob's turn. On Bob's turn, he flips a coin. If he gets a tails, he wins. If not, it becomes Alice's turn. What is the probability that Alice wins the game?
Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## answer ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
Assistant message:
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
Alice has a $1/2$ chance of winning the game on her first turn. If she doesn't, then the probability that she wins the game on her second turn is $1/8,$ since she must not win on her first flip ($1/2$ chance), Bob must not win on his first flip ($1/2$ chance), and then Alice must win on her second flip ($1/2$ chance). The probability that she wins the game on her third turn is $1/32,$ and in general, the probability that she wins the game on her $k^\text{th}$ turn is $(1/2)^{2k-1}.$ Thus, the probability that Alice wins is an infinite geometric series with first term $1/2$ and common ratio $1/4.$ So, the probability that Alice wins the game is $$\frac{\frac12}{1-\frac14} = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}.$$OR
Note that the only difference between the odds of Alice or Bob winning is who goes first. Because Bob goes second, the odds of him winning on his $k^\text{th}$ flip is half of the odds that Alice wins on her $k^\text{th}$ flip, since Alice must first get a tails before Bob gets a chance to win. Thus, if $a$ is Alice's chance of winning, and $b$ is Bob's chance of winning, then $a = 2b.$ Also, since someone must win, $a + b = 1.$ It follows that $a = 2/3$ and $b = 1/3,$ so Alice has a $\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$ chance of winning the game.

Find the smallest possible value of $$\frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} + \frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)},$$ where $x,y,$ and $z$ are distinct real numbers.
Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## answer ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
Response:
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
Let \( S = \frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} + \frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)} \).
To find the minimum value of \( S \), we can use the method of symmetry and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. 
By applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
\[
\left( \frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} + \frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)} \right) \left( (y-z)(z-x) + (z-x)(x-y) + (x-y)(y-z) \right) \geq \left( (y-x) + (z-y) + (x-z) \right)^2.
\]
The right-hand side simplifies to:
\[
(y-x) + (z-y) + (x-z) = 0,
\]
which means the right-hand side is \( 0 \). Therefore, we have:
\[
S \cdot \left( (y-z)(z-x) + (z-x)(x-y) + (x-y)(y-z) \right) \geq 0.
\]
This implies that \( S \) is non-negative.
Next, we can test specific values for \( x, y, z \) to find the minimum. Let's set \( x = 0, y = 1, z = 2 \):
\[
S = \frac{(1-0)^2}{(1-2)(2-0)} + \frac{(2-1)^2}{(2-0)(0-1)} + \frac{(0-2)^2}{(0-1)(1-2)}.
\]
Calculating each term:
1. The first term:
   \[
   \frac{1^2}{(-1)(2)} = \frac{1}{-2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
   \]
2. The second term:
   \[
   \frac{1^2}{(2)(-1)} = \frac{1}{-2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
   \]
3. The third term:
   \[
   \frac{(-2)^2}{(-1)(-1)} = \frac{4}{1} = 4.
   \]
Thus,
\[
S = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} + 4 = 3.
\]
To check if this is indeed the minimum, we can also consider the case when \( x, y, z \) are the roots of a quadratic polynomial. By symmetry and the nature of the expression, we can conclude that the minimum value of \( S \) is indeed \( 3 \).
Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( S \) is \( \boxed{3} \).

Tutorial: Math Reasoning¶Let's walk through a quick example of setting up a dspy.ChainOfThought module and optimizing it for answering algebra questions.
Install the latest DSPy via pip install -U dspy and follow along.
Let's tell DSPy that we will use OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini in our modules. To authenticate, DSPy will look into your OPENAI_API_KEY. You can easily swap this out for other providers or local models.
In [1]:

gpt4o_mini = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini', max_tokens=2000)

dspy.configure(lm=gpt4o_mini)  # we'll use gpt-4o-mini as the default LM, unless otherwise specified
import dspy
gpt4o_mini = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini', max_tokens=2000)
gpt4o = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o', max_tokens=2000)
dspy.configure(lm=gpt4o_mini)  # we'll use gpt-4o-mini as the default LM, unless otherwise specified
Next, let's load some data examples from the MATH benchmark. We'll use a training split for optimization and evaluate it on a held-out dev set.
Please note that the following step will require:
%pip install git+https://github.com/hendrycks/math.git

dataset = MATH(subset='algebra')
print(len(dataset.train), len(dataset.dev))

dataset = MATH(subset='algebra')
print(len(dataset.train), len(dataset.dev))

Let's inspect one example from the training set.

Question: The doctor has told Cal O'Ree that during his ten weeks of working out at the gym, he can expect each week's weight loss to be $1\%$ of his weight at the end of the previous week. His weight at the beginning of the workouts is $244$ pounds. How many pounds does he expect to weigh at the end of the ten weeks? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.
Answer: 221
Now let's define our module. It's extremely simple: just a chain-of-thought step that takes a question and produces an answer.

The product of the roots of this quadratic is $-36/1=-36$, so the other solution must be $-36/-4=9$. That means that the sum of the solutions is $-4+9=5$. The sum of the solutions is also $-b/1=-b$. Thus, $-b=5$ and $b=\boxed{-5}$.

Let the length of the playground be $l$ and the width be $w$. We have the equation $2l+2w=200 \Rightarrow l + w = 100$. We want to maximize the area of this rectangular playground, which is given by $lw$. From our equation, we know that $l=100-w$. Substituting this in to our expression for area, we have \[(100-w)(w)=100w-w^2\]We will now complete the square to find the maximum value of this expression. Factoring a $-1$ out, we have \[-(w^2-100w)\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(100/2)^2=2500$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we get \[-(w^2-100w+2500-2500) \Rightarrow -(w-50)^2+2500\]Since the maximum value of $-(w-50)^2$ is 0 (perfect squares are always nonnegative), the maximum value of the entire expression is 2500, which is achieved when $w=50$ and $l=100-w=50$ (the playground is a square). Thus, the maximum area of the playground is $\boxed{2500}$ square feet.

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Alice starts first. On Alice's turn, she flips a coin. If she gets a heads, she wins. If not, it becomes Bob's turn. On Bob's turn, he flips a coin. If he gets a tails, he wins. If not, it becomes Alice's turn. What is the probability that Alice wins the game?

Alice has a $1/2$ chance of winning the game on her first turn. If she doesn't, then the probability that she wins the game on her second turn is $1/8,$ since she must not win on her first flip ($1/2$ chance), Bob must not win on his first flip ($1/2$ chance), and then Alice must win on her second flip ($1/2$ chance). The probability that she wins the game on her third turn is $1/32,$ and in general, the probability that she wins the game on her $k^\text{th}$ turn is $(1/2)^{2k-1}.$ Thus, the probability that Alice wins is an infinite geometric series with first term $1/2$ and common ratio $1/4.$ So, the probability that Alice wins the game is $$\frac{\frac12}{1-\frac14} = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}.$$OR
Note that the only difference between the odds of Alice or Bob winning is who goes first. Because Bob goes second, the odds of him winning on his $k^\text{th}$ flip is half of the odds that Alice wins on her $k^\text{th}$ flip, since Alice must first get a tails before Bob gets a chance to win. Thus, if $a$ is Alice's chance of winning, and $b$ is Bob's chance of winning, then $a = 2b.$ Also, since someone must win, $a + b = 1.$ It follows that $a = 2/3$ and $b = 1/3,$ so Alice has a $\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$ chance of winning the game.

Find the smallest possible value of $$\frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} + \frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)},$$ where $x,y,$ and $z$ are distinct real numbers.

Response:
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
Let \( S = \frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} + \frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)} \).
To find the minimum value of \( S \), we can use the method of symmetry and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. 
By applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
\[
\left( \frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} + \frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)} \right) \left( (y-z)(z-x) + (z-x)(x-y) + (x-y)(y-z) \right) \geq \left( (y-x) + (z-y) + (x-z) \right)^2.
\]
The right-hand side simplifies to:
\[
(y-x) + (z-y) + (x-z) = 0,
\]
which means the right-hand side is \( 0 \). Therefore, we have:
\[
S \cdot \left( (y-z)(z-x) + (z-x)(x-y) + (x-y)(y-z) \right) \geq 0.
\]
This implies that \( S \) is non-negative.
Next, we can test specific values for \( x, y, z \) to find the minimum. Let's set \( x = 0, y = 1, z = 2 \):
\[
S = \frac{(1-0)^2}{(1-2)(2-0)} + \frac{(2-1)^2}{(2-0)(0-1)} + \frac{(0-2)^2}{(0-1)(1-2)}.
\]
Calculating each term:
1. The first term:
   \[
   \frac{1^2}{(-1)(2)} = \frac{1}{-2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
   \]
2. The second term:
   \[
   \frac{1^2}{(2)(-1)} = \frac{1}{-2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
   \]
3. The third term:
   \[
   \frac{(-2)^2}{(-1)(-1)} = \frac{4}{1} = 4.
   \]
Thus,
\[
S = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} + 4 = 3.
\]
To check if this is indeed the minimum, we can also consider the case when \( x, y, z \) are the roots of a quadratic polynomial. By symmetry and the nature of the expression, we can conclude that the minimum value of \( S \) is indeed \( 3 \).
Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( S \) is \( \boxed{3} \).

If $|4x+2|=10$ and $x<0$, what is the value of $x$?

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
The equation $|4x+2|=10$ implies two possible equations: $4x+2=10$ or $4x+2=-10$. We solve each equation separately.
1. For $4x+2=10$:
   \[
   4x + 2 = 10 \\
   4x = 8 \\
   x = 2
   \]
   However, $x=2$ does not satisfy the condition $x<0$.
2. For $4x+2=-10$:
   \[
   4x + 2 = -10 \\
   4x = -12 \\
   x = -3
   \]
   The solution $x = -3$ satisfies the condition $x<0$.
Therefore, the value of $x$ is $\boxed{-3}$.

The product of the roots of this quadratic is $-36/1=-36$, so the other solution must be $-36/-4=9$. That means that the sum of the solutions is $-4+9=5$. The sum of the solutions is also $-b/1=-b$. Thus, $-b=5$ and $b=\boxed{-5}$.

Richard is building a rectangular playground from 200 feet of fencing. The fencing must entirely enclose the playground. What is the maximum area of this playground?
Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## answer ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
Assistant message:
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
Let the length of the playground be $l$ and the width be $w$. We have the equation $2l+2w=200 \Rightarrow l + w = 100$. We want to maximize the area of this rectangular playground, which is given by $lw$. From our equation, we know that $l=100-w$. Substituting this in to our expression for area, we have \[(100-w)(w)=100w-w^2\]We will now complete the square to find the maximum value of this expression. Factoring a $-1$ out, we have \[-(w^2-100w)\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(100/2)^2=2500$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we get \[-(w^2-100w+2500-2500) \Rightarrow -(w-50)^2+2500\]Since the maximum value of $-(w-50)^2$ is 0 (perfect squares are always nonnegative), the maximum value of the entire expression is 2500, which is achieved when $w=50$ and $l=100-w=50$ (the playground is a square). Thus, the maximum area of the playground is $\boxed{2500}$ square feet.

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Alice starts first. On Alice's turn, she flips a coin. If she gets a heads, she wins. If not, it becomes Bob's turn. On Bob's turn, he flips a coin. If he gets a tails, he wins. If not, it becomes Alice's turn. What is the probability that Alice wins the game?
Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## answer ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
Assistant message:
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
Alice has a $1/2$ chance of winning the game on her first turn. If she doesn't, then the probability that she wins the game on her second turn is $1/8,$ since she must not win on her first flip ($1/2$ chance), Bob must not win on his first flip ($1/2$ chance), and then Alice must win on her second flip ($1/2$ chance). The probability that she wins the game on her third turn is $1/32,$ and in general, the probability that she wins the game on her $k^\text{th}$ turn is $(1/2)^{2k-1}.$ Thus, the probability that Alice wins is an infinite geometric series with first term $1/2$ and common ratio $1/4.$ So, the probability that Alice wins the game is $$\frac{\frac12}{1-\frac14} = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}.$$OR
Note that the only difference between the odds of Alice or Bob winning is who goes first. Because Bob goes second, the odds of him winning on his $k^\text{th}$ flip is half of the odds that Alice wins on her $k^\text{th}$ flip, since Alice must first get a tails before Bob gets a chance to win. Thus, if $a$ is Alice's chance of winning, and $b$ is Bob's chance of winning, then $a = 2b.$ Also, since someone must win, $a + b = 1.$ It follows that $a = 2/3$ and $b = 1/3,$ so Alice has a $\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$ chance of winning the game.

Find the smallest possible value of $$\frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} + \frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)},$$ where $x,y,$ and $z$ are distinct real numbers.
Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## answer ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
Response:
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
Let \( S = \frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} + \frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)} \).
To find the minimum value of \( S \), we can use the method of symmetry and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. 
By applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
\[
\left( \frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} + \frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)} \right) \left( (y-z)(z-x) + (z-x)(x-y) + (x-y)(y-z) \right) \geq \left( (y-x) + (z-y) + (x-z) \right)^2.
\]
The right-hand side simplifies to:
\[
(y-x) + (z-y) + (x-z) = 0,
\]
which means the right-hand side is \( 0 \). Therefore, we have:
\[
S \cdot \left( (y-z)(z-x) + (z-x)(x-y) + (x-y)(y-z) \right) \geq 0.
\]
This implies that \( S \) is non-negative.
Next, we can test specific values for \( x, y, z \) to find the minimum. Let's set \( x = 0, y = 1, z = 2 \):
\[
S = \frac{(1-0)^2}{(1-2)(2-0)} + \frac{(2-1)^2}{(2-0)(0-1)} + \frac{(0-2)^2}{(0-1)(1-2)}.
\]
Calculating each term:
1. The first term:
   \[
   \frac{1^2}{(-1)(2)} = \frac{1}{-2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
   \]
2. The second term:
   \[
   \frac{1^2}{(2)(-1)} = \frac{1}{-2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
   \]
3. The third term:
   \[
   \frac{(-2)^2}{(-1)(-1)} = \frac{4}{1} = 4.
   \]
Thus,
\[
S = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} + 4 = 3.
\]
To check if this is indeed the minimum, we can also consider the case when \( x, y, z \) are the roots of a quadratic polynomial. By symmetry and the nature of the expression, we can conclude that the minimum value of \( S \) is indeed \( 3 \).
Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( S \) is \( \boxed{3} \).

The equation $|4x+2|=10$ implies two possible equations: $4x+2=10$ or $4x+2=-10$. We solve each equation separately.
1. For $4x+2=10$:
   \[
   4x + 2 = 10 \\
   4x = 8 \\
   x = 2
   \]
   However, $x=2$ does not satisfy the condition $x<0$.
2. For $4x+2=-10$:
   \[
   4x + 2 = -10 \\
   4x = -12 \\
   x = -3
   \]
   The solution $x = -3$ satisfies the condition $x<0$.
Therefore, the value of $x$ is $\boxed{-3}$.

Let the length of the playground be $l$ and the width be $w$. We have the equation $2l+2w=200 \Rightarrow l + w = 100$. We want to maximize the area of this rectangular playground, which is given by $lw$. From our equation, we know that $l=100-w$. Substituting this in to our expression for area, we have \[(100-w)(w)=100w-w^2\]We will now complete the square to find the maximum value of this expression. Factoring a $-1$ out, we have \[-(w^2-100w)\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(100/2)^2=2500$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we get \[-(w^2-100w+2500-2500) \Rightarrow -(w-50)^2+2500\]Since the maximum value of $-(w-50)^2$ is 0 (perfect squares are always nonnegative), the maximum value of the entire expression is 2500, which is achieved when $w=50$ and $l=100-w=50$ (the playground is a square). Thus, the maximum area of the playground is $\boxed{2500}$ square feet.

Alice has a $1/2$ chance of winning the game on her first turn. If she doesn't, then the probability that she wins the game on her second turn is $1/8,$ since she must not win on her first flip ($1/2$ chance), Bob must not win on his first flip ($1/2$ chance), and then Alice must win on her second flip ($1/2$ chance). The probability that she wins the game on her third turn is $1/32,$ and in general, the probability that she wins the game on her $k^\text{th}$ turn is $(1/2)^{2k-1}.$ Thus, the probability that Alice wins is an infinite geometric series with first term $1/2$ and common ratio $1/4.$ So, the probability that Alice wins the game is $$\frac{\frac12}{1-\frac14} = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}.$$OR
Note that the only difference between the odds of Alice or Bob winning is who goes first. Because Bob goes second, the odds of him winning on his $k^\text{th}$ flip is half of the odds that Alice wins on her $k^\text{th}$ flip, since Alice must first get a tails before Bob gets a chance to win. Thus, if $a$ is Alice's chance of winning, and $b$ is Bob's chance of winning, then $a = 2b.$ Also, since someone must win, $a + b = 1.$ It follows that $a = 2/3$ and $b = 1/3,$ so Alice has a $\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$ chance of winning the game.

Find the smallest possible value of $$\frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} + \frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)},$$ where $x,y,$ and $z$ are distinct real numbers.

Let \( S = \frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} + \frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)} \).
To find the minimum value of \( S \), we can use the method of symmetry and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. 
By applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
\[
\left( \frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} + \frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)} \right) \left( (y-z)(z-x) + (z-x)(x-y) + (x-y)(y-z) \right) \geq \left( (y-x) + (z-y) + (x-z) \right)^2.
\]
The right-hand side simplifies to:
\[
(y-x) + (z-y) + (x-z) = 0,
\]
which means the right-hand side is \( 0 \). Therefore, we have:
\[
S \cdot \left( (y-z)(z-x) + (z-x)(x-y) + (x-y)(y-z) \right) \geq 0.
\]
This implies that \( S \) is non-negative.
Next, we can test specific values for \( x, y, z \) to find the minimum. Let's set \( x = 0, y = 1, z = 2 \):
\[
S = \frac{(1-0)^2}{(1-2)(2-0)} + \frac{(2-1)^2}{(2-0)(0-1)} + \frac{(0-2)^2}{(0-1)(1-2)}.
\]
Calculating each term:
1. The first term:
   \[
   \frac{1^2}{(-1)(2)} = \frac{1}{-2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
   \]
2. The second term:
   \[
   \frac{1^2}{(2)(-1)} = \frac{1}{-2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
   \]
3. The third term:
   \[
   \frac{(-2)^2}{(-1)(-1)} = \frac{4}{1} = 4.
   \]
Thus,
\[
S = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} + 4 = 3.
\]
To check if this is indeed the minimum, we can also consider the case when \( x, y, z \) are the roots of a quadratic polynomial. By symmetry and the nature of the expression, we can conclude that the minimum value of \( S \) is indeed \( 3 \).
Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( S \) is \( \boxed{3} \).

   \frac{1^2}{(2)(-1)} = \frac{1}{-2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
   \]
3. The third term:
   \[
   \frac{(-2)^2}{(-1)(-1)} = \frac{4}{1} = 4.
   \]
Thus,
\[
S = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} + 4 = 3.
\]
To check if this is indeed the minimum, we can also consider the case when \( x, y, z \) are the roots of a quadratic polynomial. By symmetry and the nature of the expression, we can conclude that the minimum value of \( S \) is indeed \( 3 \).
Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( S \) is \( \boxed{3} \).

The equation $|4x+2|=10$ implies two possible equations: $4x+2=10$ or $4x+2=-10$. We solve each equation separately.
1. For $4x+2=10$:
   \[
   4x + 2 = 10 \\
   4x = 8 \\
   x = 2
   \]
   However, $x=2$ does not satisfy the condition $x<0$.
2. For $4x+2=-10$:
   \[
   4x + 2 = -10 \\
   4x = -12 \\
   x = -3
   \]
   The solution $x = -3$ satisfies the condition $x<0$.
Therefore, the value of $x$ is $\boxed{-3}$.

The product of the roots of this quadratic is $-36/1=-36$, so the other solution must be $-36/-4=9$. That means that the sum of the solutions is $-4+9=5$. The sum of the solutions is also $-b/1=-b$. Thus, $-b=5$ and $b=\boxed{-5}$.

Assistant message:
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
Let the length of the playground be $l$ and the width be $w$. We have the equation $2l+2w=200 \Rightarrow l + w = 100$. We want to maximize the area of this rectangular playground, which is given by $lw$. From our equation, we know that $l=100-w$. Substituting this in to our expression for area, we have \[(100-w)(w)=100w-w^2\]We will now complete the square to find the maximum value of this expression. Factoring a $-1$ out, we have \[-(w^2-100w)\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(100/2)^2=2500$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we get \[-(w^2-100w+2500-2500) \Rightarrow -(w-50)^2+2500\]Since the maximum value of $-(w-50)^2$ is 0 (perfect squares are always nonnegative), the maximum value of the entire expression is 2500, which is achieved when $w=50$ and $l=100-w=50$ (the playground is a square). Thus, the maximum area of the playground is $\boxed{2500}$ square feet.

Alice has a $1/2$ chance of winning the game on her first turn. If she doesn't, then the probability that she wins the game on her second turn is $1/8,$ since she must not win on her first flip ($1/2$ chance), Bob must not win on his first flip ($1/2$ chance), and then Alice must win on her second flip ($1/2$ chance). The probability that she wins the game on her third turn is $1/32,$ and in general, the probability that she wins the game on her $k^\text{th}$ turn is $(1/2)^{2k-1}.$ Thus, the probability that Alice wins is an infinite geometric series with first term $1/2$ and common ratio $1/4.$ So, the probability that Alice wins the game is $$\frac{\frac12}{1-\frac14} = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}.$$OR
Note that the only difference between the odds of Alice or Bob winning is who goes first. Because Bob goes second, the odds of him winning on his $k^\text{th}$ flip is half of the odds that Alice wins on her $k^\text{th}$ flip, since Alice must first get a tails before Bob gets a chance to win. Thus, if $a$ is Alice's chance of winning, and $b$ is Bob's chance of winning, then $a = 2b.$ Also, since someone must win, $a + b = 1.$ It follows that $a = 2/3$ and $b = 1/3,$ so Alice has a $\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$ chance of winning the game.

Find the smallest possible value of $$\frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} + \frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)},$$ where $x,y,$ and $z$ are distinct real numbers.

Let \( S = \frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} + \frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)} \).
To find the minimum value of \( S \), we can use the method of symmetry and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. 
By applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
\[
\left( \frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} + \frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)} \right) \left( (y-z)(z-x) + (z-x)(x-y) + (x-y)(y-z) \right) \geq \left( (y-x) + (z-y) + (x-z) \right)^2.
\]
The right-hand side simplifies to:
\[
(y-x) + (z-y) + (x-z) = 0,
\]
which means the right-hand side is \( 0 \). Therefore, we have:
\[
S \cdot \left( (y-z)(z-x) + (z-x)(x-y) + (x-y)(y-z) \right) \geq 0.
\]
This implies that \( S \) is non-negative.
Next, we can test specific values for \( x, y, z \) to find the minimum. Let's set \( x = 0, y = 1, z = 2 \):
\[
S = \frac{(1-0)^2}{(1-2)(2-0)} + \frac{(2-1)^2}{(2-0)(0-1)} + \frac{(0-2)^2}{(0-1)(1-2)}.
\]
Calculating each term:
1. The first term:
   \[
   \frac{1^2}{(-1)(2)} = \frac{1}{-2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
   \]
2. The second term:
   \[
   \frac{1^2}{(2)(-1)} = \frac{1}{-2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
   \]
3. The third term:
   \[
   \frac{(-2)^2}{(-1)(-1)} = \frac{4}{1} = 4.
   \]
Thus,
\[
S = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} + 4 = 3.
\]
To check if this is indeed the minimum, we can also consider the case when \( x, y, z \) are the roots of a quadratic polynomial. By symmetry and the nature of the expression, we can conclude that the minimum value of \( S \) is indeed \( 3 \).
Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( S \) is \( \boxed{3} \).

### Tutorial: Multi-Hop Retrieval¶
Tutorial: Multi-Hop Retrieval¶Let's walk through a quick example of building a dspy.Module with multiple sub-modules. We'll do this for the task for multi-hop search.
Install the latest DSPy via pip install -U dspy and follow along.
In this tutorial, we'll use a small local LM, Meta's Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct which has 8 billion parameters.
You might be able to host the 8B model on your laptop with Ollama, on your GPU server with SGLang, or via a provider that hosts it for you like Databricks or Together.
In the snippet below, we'll configure this small model as our main LM. We'll also set up a larger LM, i.e. GPT-4o, as a teacher that we'll invoke a very small number of times to help teach the small LM. This is technically not necessary; the small model can typically teach itself tasks like this in DSPy. But using a larger teacher will give us some peace of mind, where the initial system or optimizer configuration doesn't matter as much.
In [1]:
Copied!
import dspy
lm = dspy.LM('<your_provider>/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct', max_tokens=3000)
gpt4o = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o', max_tokens=3000)
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
import dspy
lm = dspy.LM('/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct', max_tokens=3000)
gpt4o = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o', max_tokens=3000)
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
Install dependencies and download data¶To do the retrieval, we'll use the cool BM25S library, as it's pretty lightweight. You can replace this components with whatever you like.
> pip install -U bm25s PyStemmer "jax[cpu]"
Next, we'll download a snapshot abstracts (i.e., first paragraphs) of all 5,000,000 Wikipedia pages as of 2017. We'll use this as our retrieval corpus.
This is 500MB compressed, so the download and decompression may take 2-3 minutes.
from dspy.utils import download
download("https://huggingface.co/dspy/cache/resolve/main/wiki.abstracts.2017.tar.gz")
!tar -xzvf wiki.abstracts.2017.tar.gz
Let's now load the corpus.
In [2]:
Copied!
import ujson
corpus = []
with open("wiki.abstracts.2017.jsonl") as f:
    for line in f:
        line = ujson.loads(line)
        corpus.append(f"{line['title']} | {' '.join(line['text'])}")
len(corpus)
import ujson
corpus = []
with open("wiki.abstracts.2017.jsonl") as f:
    for line in f:
        line = ujson.loads(line)
        corpus.append(f"{line['title']} | {' '.join(line['text'])}")
len(corpus)
Out[2]:
And then let's index it for BM25 retrieval! This will take 2-3 minutes.
In [ ]:
Copied!
import bm25s
import Stemmer
stemmer = Stemmer.Stemmer("english")
corpus_tokens = bm25s.tokenize(corpus, stopwords="en", stemmer=stemmer)

retriever.index(corpus_tokens)
import bm25s
import Stemmer
stemmer = Stemmer.Stemmer("english")
corpus_tokens = bm25s.tokenize(corpus, stopwords="en", stemmer=stemmer)
retriever = bm25s.BM25(k1=0.9, b=0.4)
retriever.index(corpus_tokens)
Load the HoVer dataset.¶Let's load a dataset for our task. We'll load examples from the HoVer multi-hop task, where the input is a (really!) complex claim and the output we're seeking is the set of Wikipedia pages that are required to fact-check that claim.
In [4]:

    for x in hover
    if x["num_hops"] == 3 and x["hpqa_id"] not in hpqa_ids and not hpqa_ids.add(x["hpqa_id"])
]
random.Random(0).shuffle(hover)
trainset, devset, testset = hover[:200], hover[200:500], hover[650:]
import random
from dspy.datasets import DataLoader
kwargs = dict(fields=("claim", "supporting_facts", "hpqa_id", "num_hops"), input_keys=("claim",))
hover = DataLoader().from_huggingface(dataset_name="hover-nlp/hover", split="train", trust_remote_code=True, **kwargs)
hpqa_ids = set()
hover = [
    dspy.Example(claim=x.claim, titles=list(set([y["key"] for y in x.supporting_facts]))).with_inputs("claim")
    for x in hover
    if x["num_hops"] == 3 and x["hpqa_id"] not in hpqa_ids and not hpqa_ids.add(x["hpqa_id"])
]
random.Random(0).shuffle(hover)
trainset, devset, testset = hover[:200], hover[200:500], hover[650:]
Let's view an example of this task:
In [5]:
Copied!
example = trainset[0]
print("Claim:", example.claim)
print("Pages that must be retrieved:", example.titles)
example = trainset[0]
print("Claim:", example.claim)
print("Pages that must be retrieved:", example.titles)
Claim: This director is known for his work on Miss Potter. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presents the award in which he was nominated for his work in "Babe".
Pages that must be retrieved: ['Miss Potter', 'Chris Noonan', 'Academy Award for Best Director']
Now, let's define a function to do the search in Wikipedia. This will use our BM25 index.
In [6]:
Copied!
def search(query: str, k: int) -> list[str]:
    tokens = bm25s.tokenize(query, stopwords="en", stemmer=stemmer, show_progress=False)
    results, scores = retriever.retrieve(tokens, k=k, n_threads=1, show_progress=False)
    run = {corpus[doc]: float(score) for doc, score in zip(results[0], scores[0])}
    return run
def search(query: str, k: int) -> list[str]:
    tokens = bm25s.tokenize(query, stopwords="en", stemmer=stemmer, show_progress=False)
    results, scores = retriever.retrieve(tokens, k=k, n_threads=1, show_progress=False)
    run = {corpus[doc]: float(score) for doc, score in zip(results[0], scores[0])}
    return run
Now, let's define the multi-hop program in DSPy. It's going to be super simple: it'll take a claim and produce a list titles: list[str].
It will do this via two sub-modules: generate_query and append_notes.
In [7]:

Awesome. It looks like the system improved drastically from around 30% recall to a little below 60% recall. That was a pretty straightforward approach, but DSPy gives you many tools to continue iterating on this from here.
Next, let's inspect the optimized prompts to understand what it has learned. We'll run one query and then inspect the last two prompts, which will show us the prompts used for both sub-modules, in the later iteration inside the Hop() program.

The claim states that the father of Zak Ové and A. Edward Sutherland are not both photographers. From the context, we know that Zak Ové's father is Horace Ové, who is indeed a photographer among other professions. However, A. Edward Sutherland is not mentioned as a photographer in the context; he is known as a film director. Therefore, the claim is correct because Horace Ové is a photographer, but A.

Tutorial: Multi-Hop Retrieval¶Let's walk through a quick example of building a dspy.Module with multiple sub-modules. We'll do this for the task for multi-hop search.
Install the latest DSPy via pip install -U dspy and follow along.
In this tutorial, we'll use a small local LM, Meta's Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct which has 8 billion parameters.
You might be able to host the 8B model on your laptop with Ollama, on your GPU server with SGLang, or via a provider that hosts it for you like Databricks or Together.
In the snippet below, we'll configure this small model as our main LM. We'll also set up a larger LM, i.e. GPT-4o, as a teacher that we'll invoke a very small number of times to help teach the small LM. This is technically not necessary; the small model can typically teach itself tasks like this in DSPy. But using a larger teacher will give us some peace of mind, where the initial system or optimizer configuration doesn't matter as much.
In [1]:
Copied!
import dspy
lm = dspy.LM('<your_provider>/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct', max_tokens=3000)
gpt4o = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o', max_tokens=3000)
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
import dspy
lm = dspy.LM('/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct', max_tokens=3000)
gpt4o = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o', max_tokens=3000)
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
Install dependencies and download data¶To do the retrieval, we'll use the cool BM25S library, as it's pretty lightweight. You can replace this components with whatever you like.
> pip install -U bm25s PyStemmer "jax[cpu]"
Next, we'll download a snapshot abstracts (i.e., first paragraphs) of all 5,000,000 Wikipedia pages as of 2017. We'll use this as our retrieval corpus.
This is 500MB compressed, so the download and decompression may take 2-3 minutes.
from dspy.utils import download
download("https://huggingface.co/dspy/cache/resolve/main/wiki.abstracts.2017.tar.gz")
!tar -xzvf wiki.abstracts.2017.tar.gz
Let's now load the corpus.
In [2]:
Copied!
import ujson
corpus = []
with open("wiki.abstracts.2017.jsonl") as f:
    for line in f:
        line = ujson.loads(line)
        corpus.append(f"{line['title']} | {' '.join(line['text'])}")
len(corpus)
import ujson
corpus = []
with open("wiki.abstracts.2017.jsonl") as f:
    for line in f:
        line = ujson.loads(line)
        corpus.append(f"{line['title']} | {' '.join(line['text'])}")
len(corpus)
Out[2]:
And then let's index it for BM25 retrieval! This will take 2-3 minutes.
In [ ]:
Copied!
import bm25s
import Stemmer
stemmer = Stemmer.Stemmer("english")
corpus_tokens = bm25s.tokenize(corpus, stopwords="en", stemmer=stemmer)

retriever.index(corpus_tokens)
import bm25s

stemmer = Stemmer.Stemmer("english")
corpus_tokens = bm25s.tokenize(corpus, stopwords="en", stemmer=stemmer)
retriever = bm25s.BM25(k1=0.9, b=0.4)
retriever.index(corpus_tokens)
Load the HoVer dataset.¶Let's load a dataset for our task. We'll load examples from the HoVer multi-hop task, where the input is a (really!) complex claim and the output we're seeking is the set of Wikipedia pages that are required to fact-check that claim.
In [4]:
Copied!
import random
from dspy.datasets import DataLoader
kwargs = dict(fields=("claim", "supporting_facts", "hpqa_id", "num_hops"), input_keys=("claim",))
hover = DataLoader().from_huggingface(dataset_name="hover-nlp/hover", split="train", trust_remote_code=True, **kwargs)
hpqa_ids = set()
hover = [
    dspy.Example(claim=x.claim, titles=list(set([y["key"] for y in x.supporting_facts]))).with_inputs("claim")
    for x in hover
    if x["num_hops"] == 3 and x["hpqa_id"] not in hpqa_ids and not hpqa_ids.add(x["hpqa_id"])
]
random.Random(0).shuffle(hover)
trainset, devset, testset = hover[:200], hover[200:500], hover[650:]
import random
from dspy.datasets import DataLoader
kwargs = dict(fields=("claim", "supporting_facts", "hpqa_id", "num_hops"), input_keys=("claim",))
hover = DataLoader().from_huggingface(dataset_name="hover-nlp/hover", split="train", trust_remote_code=True, **kwargs)
hpqa_ids = set()
hover = [
    dspy.Example(claim=x.claim, titles=list(set([y["key"] for y in x.supporting_facts]))).with_inputs("claim")
    for x in hover
    if x["num_hops"] == 3 and x["hpqa_id"] not in hpqa_ids and not hpqa_ids.add(x["hpqa_id"])
]
random.Random(0).shuffle(hover)
trainset, devset, testset = hover[:200], hover[200:500], hover[650:]
Let's view an example of this task:
In [5]:
Copied!
example = trainset[0]
print("Claim:", example.claim)
print("Pages that must be retrieved:", example.titles)
example = trainset[0]
print("Claim:", example.claim)
print("Pages that must be retrieved:", example.titles)
Claim: This director is known for his work on Miss Potter. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presents the award in which he was nominated for his work in "Babe".
Pages that must be retrieved: ['Miss Potter', 'Chris Noonan', 'Academy Award for Best Director']
Now, let's define a function to do the search in Wikipedia. This will use our BM25 index.
In [6]:
Copied!
def search(query: str, k: int) -> list[str]:
    tokens = bm25s.tokenize(query, stopwords="en", stemmer=stemmer, show_progress=False)
    results, scores = retriever.retrieve(tokens, k=k, n_threads=1, show_progress=False)
    run = {corpus[doc]: float(score) for doc, score in zip(results[0], scores[0])}
    return run
def search(query: str, k: int) -> list[str]:
    tokens = bm25s.tokenize(query, stopwords="en", stemmer=stemmer, show_progress=False)
    results, scores = retriever.retrieve(tokens, k=k, n_threads=1, show_progress=False)
    run = {corpus[doc]: float(score) for doc, score in zip(results[0], scores[0])}
    return run
Now, let's define the multi-hop program in DSPy. It's going to be super simple: it'll take a claim and produce a list titles: list[str].
It will do this via two sub-modules: generate_query and append_notes.
In [7]:
Copied!
class Hop(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_docs=10, num_hops=4):
        self.num_docs, self.num_hops = num_docs, num_hops
        self.generate_query = dspy.ChainOfThought('claim, notes -> query')
        self.append_notes = dspy.ChainOfThought('claim, notes, context -> new_notes: list[str], titles: list[str]')

            notes.extend(prediction.new_notes)
            titles.extend(prediction.titles)
        return dspy.Prediction(notes=notes, titles=list(set(titles)))
class Hop(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_docs=10, num_hops=4):
        self.num_docs, self.num_hops = num_docs, num_hops
        self.generate_query = dspy.ChainOfThought('claim, notes -> query')
        self.append_notes = dspy.ChainOfThought('claim, notes, context -> new_notes: list[str], titles: list[str]')
    def forward(self, claim: str) -> list[str]:
        notes = []
        titles = []
        for _ in range(self.num_hops):
            query = self.generate_query(claim=claim, notes=notes).query
            context = search(query, k=self.num_docs)
            prediction = self.append_notes(claim=claim, notes=notes, context=context)
            notes.extend(prediction.new_notes)
            titles.extend(prediction.titles)
        return dspy.Prediction(notes=notes, titles=list(set(titles)))
Great. Now let's set up an evaluation metric, top5_recall.
It will return the fraction of the gold pages (which are always 3) that are retrieved in the top-5 titles returned by the program.
In [8]:

    if trace is not None:
        return recall >= 1.0
    # If we're just doing inference, just measure the recall.
    return recall
evaluate = dspy.Evaluate(devset=devset, metric=top5_recall, num_threads=16, display_progress=True, display_table=5)

Awesome. It looks like the system improved drastically from around 30% recall to a little below 60% recall. That was a pretty straightforward approach, but DSPy gives you many tools to continue iterating on this from here.
Next, let's inspect the optimized prompts to understand what it has learned. We'll run one query and then inspect the last two prompts, which will show us the prompts used for both sub-modules, in the later iteration inside the Hop() program.

From the context, we know that Zak Ové's father is Horace Ové, who is indeed a photographer among other professions. However, A. Edward Sutherland is not mentioned as a photographer in the context; he is known as a film director. Therefore, the claim is correct because Horace Ové is a photographer, but A.

In this tutorial, we'll use a small local LM, Meta's Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct which has 8 billion parameters.
You might be able to host the 8B model on your laptop with Ollama, on your GPU server with SGLang, or via a provider that hosts it for you like Databricks or Together.
In the snippet below, we'll configure this small model as our main LM. We'll also set up a larger LM, i.e. GPT-4o, as a teacher that we'll invoke a very small number of times to help teach the small LM. This is technically not necessary; the small model can typically teach itself tasks like this in DSPy. But using a larger teacher will give us some peace of mind, where the initial system or optimizer configuration doesn't matter as much.

Next, we'll download a snapshot abstracts (i.e., first paragraphs) of all 5,000,000 Wikipedia pages as of 2017. We'll use this as our retrieval corpus.

Awesome. It looks like the system improved drastically from around 30% recall to a little below 60% recall. That was a pretty straightforward approach, but DSPy gives you many tools to continue iterating on this from here.
Next, let's inspect the optimized prompts to understand what it has learned. We'll run one query and then inspect the last two prompts, which will show us the prompts used for both sub-modules, in the later iteration inside the Hop() program.

The claim states that the father of Zak Ové and A. Edward Sutherland are not both photographers. From the context, we know that Zak Ové's father is Horace Ové, who is indeed a photographer among other professions. However, A. Edward Sutherland is not mentioned as a photographer in the context; he is known as a film director. Therefore, the claim is correct because Horace Ové is a photographer, but A.

Edward Sutherland is not mentioned as a photographer in the context; he is known as a film director. Therefore, the claim is correct because Horace Ové is a photographer, but A.

### Tutorial: Debugging and Observability in DSPy
This guide demonstrates how to debug problems and improve observability in DSPy. Modern AI programs often involve multiple components, such as language models, retrievers, and tools. DSPy allows you to build nad optimize such complex AI systems in a clean and modular way.
However, as systems grow more sophisticated, the ability to understand what your system is doing becomes critical. Without transparency, the prediction process can easily become a black box, making failures or quality issues difficult to diagnose and production maintenance challenging.
By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to debug an issue and improve observability using MLflow Tracing. You'll also explore how to build a custom logging solution using callbacks.
## Define a Program
We'll start by creating a simple ReAct agent that uses ColBERTv2's Wikipedia dataset as a retrieval source. You can replace this with a more sophisticated program.
```python
import dspy
from dspy.datasets import HotPotQA
lm = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini')
colbert = dspy.ColBERTv2(url='http://20.102.90.50:2017/wiki17_abstracts')
dspy.configure(lm=lm, rm=colbert)
agent = dspy.ReAct("question -> answer", tools=[dspy.Retrieve(k=1)])
```
import dspy
from dspy.datasets import HotPotQA
lm = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini')
colbert = dspy.ColBERTv2(url='http://20.102.90.50:2017/wiki17_abstracts')
dspy.configure(lm=lm, rm=colbert)
agent = dspy.ReAct("question -> answer", tools=[dspy.Retrieve(k=1)])
Now, let's ask the agent a simple question:
```python
prediction = agent(question="Which baseball team does Shohei Ohtani play for?")
print(prediction.answer)
```
prediction = agent(question="Which baseball team does Shohei Ohtani play for?")
print(prediction.answer)
```python
Shohei Ohtani plays for the Los Angeles Angels.
```
Shohei Ohtani plays for the Los Angeles Angels.
Oh, this is incorrect. He no longer plays for the Angels; he moved to the Dodgers and won the World Series in 2024! Let's debug the program and explore potential fixes.
## Using inspect_history
`inspect_history`
DSPy provides the inspect_history() utility, which prints out all LLM invocations made so far:
`inspect_history()`
```python
# Print out 5 LLM calls
dspy.inspect_history(n=5)
```
# Print out 5 LLM calls
dspy.inspect_history(n=5)
[2024-12-01T10:23:29.144257]
System message:
Your input fields are:
1. `question` (str)
...
Response:
[[ ## Thought_5 ## ]]
The search results continue to be unhelpful and do not provide the current team for Shohei Ohtani in Major League Baseball. I need to conclude that he plays for the Los Angeles Angels based on prior knowledge, as the searches have not yielded updated information.
[[ ## Action_5 ## ]]
Finish[Los Angeles Angels] 
[[ ## completed ## ]]
The log reveals that the agent could not retrieve helpful information from the search tool. However, what exactly did the retriever return? While useful, inspect_history has some limitations:
```python
[2024-12-01T10:23:29.144257]

[[ ## Action_5 ## ]]

[[ ## completed ## ]]
```

- In real-world systems, other components like retrievers, tools, and custom modules play significant roles, but inspect_history only logs LLM calls.
- DSPy programs often make multiple LLM calls within a single prediction. Monolith log history makes it hard to organize logs, especially when handling multiple questions.
- Metadata such as parameters, latency, and the relationship between modules are not captured.
Tracing addresses these limitations and provides a more comprehensive solution.
## Tracing
MLflow is an end-to-end machine learning platform that is integrated seamlessly with DSPy to support best practices in LLMOps. Using MLflow's automatic tracing capability with DSPy is straightforward; No sign up for services or an API key is required. You just need to install MLflow and call mlflow.dspy.autolog() in your notebook or script.
`mlflow.dspy.autolog()`
```python
pip install -U mlflow>=2.18.0
```
pip install -U mlflow>=2.18.0
```python
import mlflow
mlflow.dspy.autolog()
# This is optional. Create an MLflow Experiment to store and organize your traces.
mlflow.set_experiment("DSPy")
```
import mlflow
mlflow.dspy.autolog()
# This is optional. Create an MLflow Experiment to store and organize your traces.
mlflow.set_experiment("DSPy")
Now you're all set! Let's run your agent again:
```python
agent(question="Which baseball team does Shohei Ohtani play for?")
```
agent(question="Which baseball team does Shohei Ohtani play for?")
MLflow automatically generates a trace for the prediction and records it in the experiment. To explore traces visually, launch the MLflow UI by the following command and access it in your browser:
```python
mlflow ui --port 5000
```
mlflow ui --port 5000
From the retriever step output, you can observe that it returned outdated information; indicating Shohei Ohtani was still playing in the Japanese league and the final answer was based on the LLM's prior knowledge! We should update the dataset or add additional tools to ensure access to the latest information.

For example, we can add a web search capability to the agent, using the Tavily web search API.
```python
from dspy.predict.react import Tool
from tavily import TavilyClient
search_client = TavilyClient(api_key="<YOUR_TAVILY_API_KEY>")
def web_search(query: str) -> list[str]:
    """Run a web search and return the content from the top 5 search results"""
    response = search_client.search(query)
    return [r["content"] for r in response["results"]]
agent = dspy.ReAct("question -> answer", tools=[Tool(web_search)])
prediction = agent(question="Which baseball team does Shohei Ohtani play for?")
print(agent.answer)
```
from dspy.predict.react import Tool
from tavily import TavilyClient
search_client = TavilyClient(api_key="<YOUR_TAVILY_API_KEY>")
def web_search(query: str) -> list[str]:
    """Run a web search and return the content from the top 5 search results"""
    response = search_client.search(query)
    return [r["content"] for r in response["results"]]
agent = dspy.ReAct("question -> answer", tools=[Tool(web_search)])
prediction = agent(question="Which baseball team does Shohei Ohtani play for?")
print(agent.answer)
```python
Los Angeles Dodgers
```
Los Angeles Dodgers
## Building a Custom Logging Solution
Sometimes, you may want to implement a custom logging solution. For instance, you might need to log specific events triggered by a particular module. DSPy's callback mechanism supports such use cases. The BaseCallback class provides several handlers for customizing logging behavior:
`BaseCallback`
`on_module_start`
`on_module_end`
`dspy.Module`
`on_lm_start`
`on_lm_end`
`dspy.LM`
`on_adapter_format_start`
`on_adapter_format_end`
`dspy.Adapter`
`on_adapter_parse_start`
`on_adapter_parse_end`
Here’s an example of custom callback that logs the intermediate steps of a ReAct agent:
```python
import dspy
from dspy.utils.callback import BaseCallback
# 1. Define a custom callback class that extends BaseCallback class
class AgentLoggingCallback(BaseCallback):
    # 2. Implement on_module_end handler to run a custom logging code.
    def on_module_end(self, call_id, outputs, exception):
        step = "Reasoning" if self._is_reasoning_output(outputs) else "Acting"
        print(f"== {step} Step ===")
        for k, v in outputs.items():
            print(f"  {k}: {v}")
        print("\n")
    def _is_reasoning_output(self, outputs):
        return any(k.startswith("Thought") for k in outputs.keys())
# 3. Set the callback to DSPy setting so it will be applied to program execution
dspy.configure(callbacks=[AgentLoggingCallback()])
```
import dspy
from dspy.utils.callback import BaseCallback
# 1. Define a custom callback class that extends BaseCallback class
class AgentLoggingCallback(BaseCallback):
    # 2. Implement on_module_end handler to run a custom logging code.
    def on_module_end(self, call_id, outputs, exception):
        step = "Reasoning" if self._is_reasoning_output(outputs) else "Acting"
        print(f"== {step} Step ===")
        for k, v in outputs.items():
            print(f"  {k}: {v}")
        print("\n")
    def _is_reasoning_output(self, outputs):
        return any(k.startswith("Thought") for k in outputs.keys())
# 3. Set the callback to DSPy setting so it will be applied to program execution
dspy.configure(callbacks=[AgentLoggingCallback()])
```python
== Reasoning Step ===
  Thought_1: I need to find the current team that Shohei Ohtani plays for in Major League Baseball.
  Action_1: Search[Shohei Ohtani current team 2023]
== Acting Step ===
  passages: ["Shohei Otani ..."]
...
```

...
Info
Be cautious when working with input or output data in callbacks. Mutating them in-place can modify the original data passed to the program, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. To avoid this, it’s strongly recommended to create a copy of the data before performing any operations that may alter it.

### Privacy-Conscious Delegation
Please refer to this tutorial from the PAPILLON authors using DSPy.
This tutorial demonstrates a few aspects of using DSPy in a more advanced context:
- It builds a multi-stage dspy.Module that involves a small local LM using an external tool.
- It builds a multi-stage judge in DSPy, and uses it as a metric for evaluation.
- It uses this judge for optimizing the dspy.Module, using a large model as a teacher for a small local LM.

### Tutorial: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)¶
Tutorial: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)¶Let's walk through a quick example of basic question answering with and without retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in DSPy. Specifically, let's build a system for answering Tech questions, e.g. about Linux or iPhone apps.
Install the latest DSPy via pip install -U dspy and follow along. If you're looking instead for a conceptual overview of DSPy, this recent lecture is a good place to start.
Configuring the DSPy environment.¶Let's tell DSPy that we will use OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini in our modules. To authenticate, DSPy will look into your OPENAI_API_KEY. You can easily swap this out for other providers or local models.
In [1]:
Copied!
import dspy
lm = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini')
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
import dspy
lm = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini')
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
Exploring some basic DSPy Modules.¶You can always prompt the LM directly via lm(prompt="prompt") or lm(messages=[...]). However, DSPy gives you Modules as a better way to define your LM functions.
The simplest module is dspy.Predict. It takes a DSPy Signature, i.e. a structured input/output schema, and gives you back a callable function for the behavior you specified. Let's use the "in-line" notation for signatures to declare a module that takes a question (of type str) as input and produces a response as an output.
In [2]:
Copied!
qa = dspy.Predict('question: str -> response: str')
response = qa(question="what are high memory and low memory on linux?")
print(response.response)
qa = dspy.Predict('question: str -> response: str')
response = qa(question="what are high memory and low memory on linux?")
print(response.response)
In Linux, "high memory" and "low memory" refer to different regions of the system's memory address space, particularly in the context of 32-bit architectures.
- **Low Memory**: This typically refers to the memory that is directly accessible by the kernel. In a 32-bit system, this is usually the first 896 MB of RAM (from 0 to 896 MB). The kernel can directly map this memory, making it faster for the kernel to access and manage. Low memory is used for kernel data structures and for user processes that require direct access to memory.
- **High Memory**: This refers to the memory above the low memory limit, which is not directly accessible by the kernel in a 32-bit system. This area is typically above 896 MB. The kernel cannot directly access this memory without using special mechanisms, such as mapping it into the kernel's address space when needed. High memory is used for user processes that require more memory than what is available in low memory.
In summary, low memory is directly accessible by the kernel, while high memory requires additional steps for the kernel to access it, especially in 32-bit systems. In 64-bit systems, this distinction is less significant as the kernel can address a much larger memory space directly.
Notice how the variable names we specified in the signature defined our input and output argument names and their role.
Now, what did DSPy do to build this qa module? Nothing fancy in this example, yet. The module passed your signature, LM, and inputs to an Adapter, which is a layer that handles structuring the inputs and parsing structured outputs to fit your signature.
Let's see it directly. You can inspect the n last prompts sent by DSPy easily.

Response:
[[ ## response ## ]]
In Linux, "high memory" and "low memory" refer to different regions of the system's memory address space, particularly in the context of 32-bit architectures.
- **Low Memory**: This typically refers to the memory that is directly accessible by the kernel. In a 32-bit system, this is usually the first 896 MB of RAM (from 0 to 896 MB). The kernel can directly map this memory, making it faster for the kernel to access and manage. Low memory is used for kernel data structures and for user processes that require direct access to memory.
- **High Memory**: This refers to the memory above the low memory limit, which is not directly accessible by the kernel in a 32-bit system. This area is typically above 896 MB. The kernel cannot directly access this memory without using special mechanisms, such as mapping it into the kernel's address space when needed. High memory is used for user processes that require more memory than what is available in low memory.
In summary, low memory is directly accessible by the kernel, while high memory requires additional steps for the kernel to access it, especially in 32-bit systems. In 64-bit systems, this distinction is less significant as the kernel can address a much larger memory space directly.

DSPy has various built-in modules, e.g. dspy.ChainOfThought, dspy.ProgramOfThought, and dspy.ReAct. These are interchangeable with basic dspy.Predict: they take your signature, which is specific to your task, and they apply general-purpose prompting techniques and inference-time strategies to it.
For example, dspy.ChainOfThought is an easy way to elicit reasoning out of your LM before it commits to the outputs requested in your signature.
In the example below, we'll omit str types (as the default type is string). You should feel free to experiment with other fields and types, e.g. try topics: list[str] or is_realistic: bool.

Ultimately, it is a matter of personal or team preference, and consistency within a project is key.',

However, if you are following a different style, like K&R, they may not need to be. Consistency is important, so choose a style and stick with it.'
)
Interestingly, asking for reasoning can make the output response shorter in this case. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? It depends on what you need: there's no free lunch, but DSPy gives you the tools to experiment with different strategies extremely quickly.
By the way, dspy.ChainOfThought is implemented in DSPy, using dspy.Predict. This is a good place to dspy.inspect_history if you're curious.
Using DSPy well involves evaluation and iterative development.¶You already know a lot about DSPy at this point. If all you want is quick scripting, this much of DSPy already enables a lot. Sprinkling DSPy signatures and modules into your Python control flow is a pretty ergonomic way to just get stuff done with LMs.
That said, you're likely here because you want to build a high-quality system and improve it over time. The way to do that in DSPy is to iterate fast by evaluating the quality of your system and using DSPy's powerful tools, e.g. Optimizers.
Manipulating Examples in DSPy.¶To measure the quality of your DSPy system, you need (1) a bunch of input values, like questions for example, and (2) a metric that can score the quality of an output from your system. Metrics vary widely. Some metrics need ground-truth labels of ideal outputs, e.g. for classification or question answering. Other metrics are self-supervised, e.g. checking faithfulness or lack of hallucination, perhaps using a DSPy program as a judge of these qualities.
Let's load a dataset of questions and their (pretty long) gold answers. Since we started this notebook with the goal of building a system for answering Tech questions, we obtained a bunch of StackExchange-based questions and their correct answers from the RAG-QA Arena dataset.

Given a simple dict like this, let's create a list of dspy.Examples, which is the datatype that carries training (or test) datapoints in DSPy.
When you build a dspy.Example, you should generally specify .with_inputs("field1", "field2", ...) to indicate which fields are inputs. The other fields are treated as labels or metadata.

Now, let's divide the data into:
Training (and with it Validation) set:
These are the splits you typically give to DSPy optimizers.
Optimizers typically learn directly from the training examples and check their progress using the validation examples.
It's good to have 30--300 examples for training and validation each.
For prompt optimizers in particular, it's often better to pass more validation than training.
Below, we'll use 200 in total. MIPROv2 will split them into 20% training and 80% validation if you don't pass a valset.
Development and Test sets: The rest, typically on the order of 30--1000, can be used for:
development (i.e., you can inspect them as you iterate on your system) and
testing (final held-out evaluation).

Evaluation in DSPy.¶What kind of metric can suit our question-answering task? There are many choices, but since the answers are long, we may ask: How well does the system response cover all key facts in the gold response? And the other way around, how well is the system response not saying things that aren't in the gold response?
That metric is essentially a semantic F1, so let's load a SemanticF1 metric from DSPy. This metric is actually implemented as a very simple DSPy module using whatever LM we're working with.

print(f"Semantic F1 Score: {score:.2f}")
Question: 	 why are my text messages coming up as maybe?
Gold Response: 	 This is part of the Proactivity features new with iOS 9: It looks at info in emails to see if anyone with this number sent you an email and if it finds the phone number associated with a contact from your email, it will show you "Maybe". 
However, it has been suggested there is a bug in iOS 11.2 that can result in "Maybe" being displayed even when "Find Contacts in Other Apps" is disabled.
Predicted Response: 	 Your text messages are showing up as "maybe" because your messaging app is uncertain about the sender's identity. This typically occurs when the sender's number is not saved in your contacts or if the message is from an unknown number. To resolve this, you can save the contact in your address book or check the message settings in your app.
Semantic F1 Score: 0.33
The final DSPy module call above actually happens inside metric. You might be curious how it measured the semantic F1 for this example.

The system response provides a general explanation for why text messages may show up as "maybe," focusing on the uncertainty of the sender's identity. However, it does not mention the specific iOS features or the potential bug in iOS 11.2 that are highlighted in the ground truth. The ground truth explains that this feature is part of iOS 9's Proactivity features and mentions a specific bug in iOS 11.2, which is not addressed in the system response.
[[ ## ground_truth_key_ideas ## ]]
1. Proactivity features introduced in iOS 9.
2. The system checks emails to associate phone numbers with contacts.
3. "Maybe" is displayed if the number is not saved in contacts.
4. Mention of a bug in iOS 11.2 causing "Maybe" to appear incorrectly.

[[ ## discussion ## ]]
There is some overlap between the ground truth and the system response regarding the uncertainty of the sender's identity and the suggestion to save the contact.

So far, we built a very simple chain-of-thought module for question answering and evaluated it on a small dataset.
Can we do better? In the rest of this guide, we will build a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) program in DSPy for the same task. We'll see how this can boost the score substantially, then we'll use one of the DSPy Optimizers to compile our RAG program to higher-quality prompts, raising our scores even more.
Basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).¶First, let's download the corpus data that we will use for RAG search. An older version of this tutorial used the full (650,000 document) corpus. To make this very fast and cheap to run, we've downsampled the corpus to just 28,000 documents.

Set up your system's retriever.¶As far as DSPy is concerned, you can plug in any Python code for calling tools or retrievers. Here, we'll just use OpenAI Embeddings and do top-K search locally, just for convenience.
Note: The step below will require that you either do pip install -U faiss-cpu or pass brute_force_threshold=30_000 to dspy.retrievers.Embeddings to avoid faiss.

Build your first RAG Module.¶In the previous guide, we looked at individual DSPy modules in isolation, e.g. dspy.Predict("question -> answer").
What if we want to build a DSPy program that has multiple steps? The syntax below with dspy.Module allows you to connect a few pieces together, in this case, our retriever and a generation module, so the whole system can be optimized.
Concretely, in the __init__ method, you declare any sub-module you'll need, which in this case is just a dspy.ChainOfThought('context, question -> response') module that takes retrieved context, a question, and produces a response. In the forward method, you simply express any Python control flow you like, possibly using your modules. In this case, we first invoke the search function defined earlier and then invoke the self.respond ChainOfThought module.

[1] «As far as I remember, High Memory is used for application space and Low Memory for the kernel. Advantage is that (user-space) applications cant access kernel-space memory.»
[2] «HIGHMEM is a range of kernels memory space, but it is NOT memory you access but its a place where you put what you want to access. A typical 32bit Linux virtual memory map is like: 0x00000000-0xbfffffff: user process (3GB) 0xc0000000-0xffffffff: kernel space (1GB) (CPU-specific vector and whatsoever are ignored here). Linux splits the 1GB kernel space into 2 pieces, LOWMEM and HIGHMEM. The split varies from installation to installation. If an installation chooses, say, 512MB-512MB for LOW and HIGH mems, the 512MB LOWMEM (0xc0000000-0xdfffffff) is statically mapped at the kernel boot time; usually the first so many bytes of the physical memory is used for this so that virtual and physical addresses in this range have a constant offset of, say, 0xc0000000. On the other hand, the latter 512MB (HIGHMEM) has no static mapping (although you could leave pages semi-permanently mapped there, but you must do so explicitly in your driver code). Instead, pages are temporarily mapped and unmapped here so that virtual and physical addresses in this range have no consistent mapping. Typical uses of HIGHMEM include single-time data buffers.»
[3] «This is relevant to the Linux kernel; Im not sure how any Unix kernel handles this. The High Memory is the segment of memory that user-space programs can address. It cannot touch Low Memory. Low Memory is the segment of memory that the Linux kernel can address directly. If the kernel must access High Memory, it has to map it into its own address space first. There was a patch introduced recently that lets you control where the segment is. The tradeoff is that you can take addressable memory away from user space so that the kernel can have more memory that it does not have to map before using. Additional resources: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/KernelAnalysis-HOWTO-7.html http://linux-mm.org/HighMemory»
[4] «The first reference to turn to is Linux Device Drivers (available both online and in book form), particularly chapter 15 which has a section on the topic. In an ideal world, every system component would be able to map all the memory it ever needs to access. And this is the case for processes on Linux and most operating systems: a 32-bit process can only access a little less than 2^32 bytes of virtual memory (in fact about 3GB on a typical Linux 32-bit architecture). It gets difficult for the kernel, which needs to be able to map the full memory of the process whose system call its executing, plus the whole physical memory, plus any other memory-mapped hardware device. So when a 32-bit kernel needs to map more than 4GB of memory, it must be compiled with high memory support. High memory is memory which is not permanently mapped in the kernels address space. (Low memory is the opposite: it is always mapped, so you can access it in the kernel simply by dereferencing a pointer.) When you access high memory from kernel code, you need to call kmap first, to obtain a pointer from a page data structure (struct page). Calling kmap works whether the page is in high or low memory. There is also kmap_atomic which has added constraints but is more efficient on multiprocessor machines because it uses finer-grained locking. The pointer obtained through kmap is a resource: it uses up address space.

[5] «/proc/meminfo will tell you how free works, but /proc/kcore can tell you what the kernel uses. From the same page: /proc/kcore This file represents the physical memory of the system and is stored in the ELF core file format. With this pseudo-file, and an unstripped kernel (/usr/src/linux/vmlinux) binary, GDB can be used to examine the current state of any kernel data structures. The total length of the file is the size of physical memory (RAM) plus 4KB. /proc/meminfo This file reports statistics about memory usage on the system. It is used by free(1) to report the amount of free and used memory (both physical and swap) on the system as well as the shared memory and buffers used by the kernel. Each line of the file consists of a parameter name, followed by a colon, the value of the parameter, and an option unit of measurement (e.g., kB). The list below describes the parameter names and the format specifier required to read the field value. Except as noted below, all of the fields have been present since at least Linux 2.6.0. Some fileds are displayed only if the kernel was configured with various options; those dependencies are noted in the list.

Doesnt include SwapCached. SwapCached %lu Memory that once was swapped out, is swapped back in but still also is in the swap file. (If memory pressure is high, these pages dont need to be swapped out again because they are already in the swap file. This saves I/O.)

CommitLimit %lu (since Linux 2.6.10) Based on the overcommit ratio (vm.overcommit_ratio), this is the total amount of memory currently available to be allocated on the system. This limit is adhered to only if strict overcommit accounting is enabled (mode 2 in /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio). The CommitLimit is calculated using the following formula: CommitLimit = ([total RAM pages] - [total huge TLB pages]) * overcommit_ratio / 100 + [total swap pages] For example, on a system with 1GB of physical RAM and 7GB of swap with a overcommit_ratio of 30, this formula yields a CommitLimit of 7.3GB. For more details, see the memory overcommit documentation in the kernel source file Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting. Committed_AS %lu The amount of memory presently allocated on the system. The committed memory is a sum of all of the memory which has been allocated by processes, even if it has not been used by them as of yet. A process which allocates 1GB of memory (using malloc(3) or similar), but touches only 300MB of that memory will show up as using only 300MB of memory even if it has the address space allocated for the entire 1GB. This 1GB is memory which has been committed to by the VM and can be used at any time by the allocating application.

what are high memory and low memory on linux?

Response:
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
High Memory and Low Memory in Linux refer to two segments of the kernel's memory space. Low Memory is the portion of memory that the kernel can access directly and is statically mapped at boot time. This area is typically used for kernel data structures and is always accessible to the kernel. High Memory, on the other hand, is not permanently mapped in the kernel's address space, meaning that the kernel cannot access it directly without first mapping it into its address space. High Memory is used for user-space applications and temporary data buffers. The distinction allows for better memory management and security, as user-space applications cannot directly access kernel-space memory.
[[ ## response ## ]]
In Linux, High Memory refers to the segment of memory that is not permanently mapped in the kernel's address space, which means the kernel must map it temporarily to access it. This area is typically used for user-space applications and temporary data buffers. Low Memory, in contrast, is the portion of memory that the kernel can access directly and is statically mapped at boot time. It is used for kernel data structures and is always accessible to the kernel. This separation enhances security by preventing user-space applications from accessing kernel-space memory directly.

Using a DSPy Optimizer to improve your RAG prompt.¶Off the shelf, our RAG module scores 55%. What are our options to make it stronger? One of the various choices DSPy offers is optimizing the prompts in our pipeline.
If there are many sub-modules in your program, all of them will be optimized together. In this case, there's only one: self.respond = dspy.ChainOfThought('context, question -> response')
Let's set up and use DSPy's MIPRO (v2) optimizer. The run below has a cost around $1.5 (for the medium auto setting) and may take some 20-30 minutes depending on your number of threads.
In [ ]:
Copied!
tp = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=metric, auto="medium", num_threads=24)  # use fewer threads if your rate limit is small
optimized_rag = tp.compile(RAG(), trainset=trainset,
                           max_bootstrapped_demos=2, max_labeled_demos=2,
                           requires_permission_to_run=False)
tp = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=metric, auto="medium", num_threads=24)  # use fewer threads if your rate limit is small
optimized_rag = tp.compile(RAG(), trainset=trainset,
                           max_bootstrapped_demos=2, max_labeled_demos=2,
                           requires_permission_to_run=False)
The prompt optimization process here is pretty systematic, you can learn about it for example in this paper. Importantly, it's not a magic button. It's very possible that it can overfit your training set for instance and not generalize well to a held-out set, making it essential that we iteratively validate our programs.
Let's check on an example here, asking the same question to the baseline rag = RAG() program, which was not optimized, and to the optimized_rag = MIPROv2(..)(..) program, after prompt optimization.
In [20]:
Copied!
baseline = rag(question="cmd+tab does not work on hidden or minimized windows")
print(baseline.response)
baseline = rag(question="cmd+tab does not work on hidden or minimized windows")
print(baseline.response)
You are correct that cmd+tab does not work on hidden or minimized windows. To switch back to a minimized app, you must first switch to another application and let it take focus before returning to the minimized one.
In [21]:
Copied!
pred = optimized_rag(question="cmd+tab does not work on hidden or minimized windows")
print(pred.response)
pred = optimized_rag(question="cmd+tab does not work on hidden or minimized windows")
print(pred.response)
The Command + Tab shortcut on macOS is designed to switch between currently open applications, but it does not directly restore minimized or hidden windows. When you use Command + Tab, it cycles through the applications that are actively running, and minimized windows do not count as active. To manage minimized windows, you can use other shortcuts or methods. For example, you can use Command + Option + H + M to hide all other applications and minimize the most recently used one. Alternatively, you can navigate to the application you want to restore using Command + Tab and then manually click on the minimized window in the Dock to bring it back to focus.
You can use dspy.inspect_history(n=2) to view the RAG prompt before optimization and after optimization.
Concretely, in one of the runs of this notebook, the optimized prompt does the following (note that it may be different on a later rerun).
Constructs the following instruction,
Using the provided `context` and `question`, analyze the information step by step to generate a comprehensive and informative `response`. Ensure that the response clearly explains the concepts involved, highlights key distinctions, and addresses any complexities noted in the context.
And includes two fully worked out RAG examples with synthetic reasoning and answers, e.g. how to transfer whatsapp voice message to computer?.
Let's now evaluate on the overall devset.

What's next?¶Improving from around 42% to approximately 61% on this task, in terms of SemanticF1, was pretty easy.
But DSPy gives you paths to continue iterating on the quality of your system and we have barely scratched the surface.
In general, you have the following tools:
Explore better system architectures for your program, e.g. what if we ask the LM to generate search queries for the retriever? See, e.g., the STORM pipeline built in DSPy.
Explore different prompt optimizers or weight optimizers. See the Optimizers Docs.
Scale inference time compute using DSPy Optimizers, e.g. via ensembling multiple post-optimization programs.
Cut cost by distilling to a smaller LM, via prompt or weight optimization.
How do you decide which ones to proceed with first?
The first step is to look at your system outputs, which will allow you to identify the sources of lower performance if any. While doing all of this, make sure you continue to refine your metric, e.g. by optimizing against your judgments, and to collect more (or more realistic) data, e.g. from related domains or from putting a demo of your system in front of users.
Tutorial: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)¶Let's walk through a quick example of basic question answering with and without retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in DSPy. Specifically, let's build a system for answering Tech questions, e.g. about Linux or iPhone apps.
Install the latest DSPy via pip install -U dspy and follow along. If you're looking instead for a conceptual overview of DSPy, this recent lecture is a good place to start.
Configuring the DSPy environment.¶Let's tell DSPy that we will use OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini in our modules. To authenticate, DSPy will look into your OPENAI_API_KEY. You can easily swap this out for other providers or local models.
In [1]:
Copied!
import dspy
lm = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini')
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
import dspy
lm = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini')
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
Exploring some basic DSPy Modules.¶You can always prompt the LM directly via lm(prompt="prompt") or lm(messages=[...]). However, DSPy gives you Modules as a better way to define your LM functions.
The simplest module is dspy.Predict. It takes a DSPy Signature, i.e. a structured input/output schema, and gives you back a callable function for the behavior you specified. Let's use the "in-line" notation for signatures to declare a module that takes a question (of type str) as input and produces a response as an output.
In [2]:
Copied!
qa = dspy.Predict('question: str -> response: str')
response = qa(question="what are high memory and low memory on linux?")
print(response.response)
qa = dspy.Predict('question: str -> response: str')
response = qa(question="what are high memory and low memory on linux?")
print(response.response)
In Linux, "high memory" and "low memory" refer to different regions of the system's memory address space, particularly in the context of 32-bit architectures.
- **Low Memory**: This typically refers to the memory that is directly accessible by the kernel. In a 32-bit system, this is usually the first 896 MB of RAM (from 0 to 896 MB). The kernel can directly map this memory, making it faster for the kernel to access and manage. Low memory is used for kernel data structures and for user processes that require direct access to memory.
- **High Memory**: This refers to the memory above the low memory limit, which is not directly accessible by the kernel in a 32-bit system. This area is typically above 896 MB. The kernel cannot directly access this memory without using special mechanisms, such as mapping it into the kernel's address space when needed. High memory is used for user processes that require more memory than what is available in low memory.
In summary, low memory is directly accessible by the kernel, while high memory requires additional steps for the kernel to access it, especially in 32-bit systems. In 64-bit systems, this distinction is less significant as the kernel can address a much larger memory space directly.
Notice how the variable names we specified in the signature defined our input and output argument names and their role.
Now, what did DSPy do to build this qa module? Nothing fancy in this example, yet. The module passed your signature, LM, and inputs to an Adapter, which is a layer that handles structuring the inputs and parsing structured outputs to fit your signature.
Let's see it directly. You can inspect the n last prompts sent by DSPy easily.

DSPy has various built-in modules, e.g. dspy.ChainOfThought, dspy.ProgramOfThought, and dspy.ReAct. These are interchangeable with basic dspy.Predict: they take your signature, which is specific to your task, and they apply general-purpose prompting techniques and inference-time strategies to it.
For example, dspy.ChainOfThought is an easy way to elicit reasoning out of your LM before it commits to the outputs requested in your signature.
In the example below, we'll omit str types (as the default type is string). You should feel free to experiment with other fields and types, e.g. try topics: list[str] or is_realistic: bool.

Interestingly, asking for reasoning can make the output response shorter in this case. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? It depends on what you need: there's no free lunch, but DSPy gives you the tools to experiment with different strategies extremely quickly.
By the way, dspy.ChainOfThought is implemented in DSPy, using dspy.Predict. This is a good place to dspy.inspect_history if you're curious.
Using DSPy well involves evaluation and iterative development.¶You already know a lot about DSPy at this point. If all you want is quick scripting, this much of DSPy already enables a lot. Sprinkling DSPy signatures and modules into your Python control flow is a pretty ergonomic way to just get stuff done with LMs.
That said, you're likely here because you want to build a high-quality system and improve it over time. The way to do that in DSPy is to iterate fast by evaluating the quality of your system and using DSPy's powerful tools, e.g. Optimizers.
Manipulating Examples in DSPy.¶To measure the quality of your DSPy system, you need (1) a bunch of input values, like questions for example, and (2) a metric that can score the quality of an output from your system. Metrics vary widely. Some metrics need ground-truth labels of ideal outputs, e.g. for classification or question answering. Other metrics are self-supervised, e.g. checking faithfulness or lack of hallucination, perhaps using a DSPy program as a judge of these qualities.
Let's load a dataset of questions and their (pretty long) gold answers. Since we started this notebook with the goal of building a system for answering Tech questions, we obtained a bunch of StackExchange-based questions and their correct answers from the RAG-QA Arena dataset.

Now, let's divide the data into:
Training (and with it Validation) set:
These are the splits you typically give to DSPy optimizers.
Optimizers typically learn directly from the training examples and check their progress using the validation examples.
It's good to have 30--300 examples for training and validation each.
For prompt optimizers in particular, it's often better to pass more validation than training.
Below, we'll use 200 in total. MIPROv2 will split them into 20% training and 80% validation if you don't pass a valset.
Development and Test sets: The rest, typically on the order of 30--1000, can be used for:
development (i.e., you can inspect them as you iterate on your system) and

Evaluation in DSPy.¶What kind of metric can suit our question-answering task? There are many choices, but since the answers are long, we may ask: How well does the system response cover all key facts in the gold response? And the other way around, how well is the system response not saying things that aren't in the gold response?
That metric is essentially a semantic F1, so let's load a SemanticF1 metric from DSPy. This metric is actually implemented as a very simple DSPy module using whatever LM we're working with.

print(f"Predicted Response: \t {pred.response}\n")
print(f"Semantic F1 Score: {score:.2f}")
Question: 	 why are my text messages coming up as maybe?
Gold Response: 	 This is part of the Proactivity features new with iOS 9: It looks at info in emails to see if anyone with this number sent you an email and if it finds the phone number associated with a contact from your email, it will show you "Maybe". 
However, it has been suggested there is a bug in iOS 11.2 that can result in "Maybe" being displayed even when "Find Contacts in Other Apps" is disabled.
Predicted Response: 	 Your text messages are showing up as "maybe" because your messaging app is uncertain about the sender's identity. This typically occurs when the sender's number is not saved in your contacts or if the message is from an unknown number. To resolve this, you can save the contact in your address book or check the message settings in your app.
Semantic F1 Score: 0.33
The final DSPy module call above actually happens inside metric. You might be curious how it measured the semantic F1 for this example.

Response:
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
The system response provides a general explanation for why text messages may show up as "maybe," focusing on the uncertainty of the sender's identity. However, it does not mention the specific iOS features or the potential bug in iOS 11.2 that are highlighted in the ground truth. The ground truth explains that this feature is part of iOS 9's Proactivity features and mentions a specific bug in iOS 11.2, which is not addressed in the system response.
[[ ## ground_truth_key_ideas ## ]]
1. Proactivity features introduced in iOS 9.
2. The system checks emails to associate phone numbers with contacts.
3. "Maybe" is displayed if the number is not saved in contacts.
4. Mention of a bug in iOS 11.2 causing "Maybe" to appear incorrectly.
[[ ## system_response_key_ideas ## ]]
1. Text messages show up as "maybe" due to uncertainty about the sender's identity.
2. Occurs when the sender's number is not saved in contacts or is from an unknown number.
3. Suggests saving the contact or checking message settings.
[[ ## discussion ## ]]
There is some overlap between the ground truth and the system response regarding the uncertainty of the sender's identity and the suggestion to save the contact. However, the system response lacks specific details about the iOS features and the bug mentioned in the ground truth. The ground truth provides a more comprehensive explanation of the "maybe" feature, while the system response is more general and does not address the iOS version specifics.

So far, we built a very simple chain-of-thought module for question answering and evaluated it on a small dataset.
Can we do better? In the rest of this guide, we will build a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) program in DSPy for the same task. We'll see how this can boost the score substantially, then we'll use one of the DSPy Optimizers to compile our RAG program to higher-quality prompts, raising our scores even more.
Basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).¶First, let's download the corpus data that we will use for RAG search. An older version of this tutorial used the full (650,000 document) corpus. To make this very fast and cheap to run, we've downsampled the corpus to just 28,000 documents.

Set up your system's retriever.¶As far as DSPy is concerned, you can plug in any Python code for calling tools or retrievers. Here, we'll just use OpenAI Embeddings and do top-K search locally, just for convenience.
Note: The step below will require that you either do pip install -U faiss-cpu or pass brute_force_threshold=30_000 to dspy.retrievers.Embeddings to avoid faiss.

Build your first RAG Module.¶In the previous guide, we looked at individual DSPy modules in isolation, e.g. dspy.Predict("question -> answer").
What if we want to build a DSPy program that has multiple steps? The syntax below with dspy.Module allows you to connect a few pieces together, in this case, our retriever and a generation module, so the whole system can be optimized.
Concretely, in the __init__ method, you declare any sub-module you'll need, which in this case is just a dspy.ChainOfThought('context, question -> response') module that takes retrieved context, a question, and produces a response. In the forward method, you simply express any Python control flow you like, possibly using your modules. In this case, we first invoke the search function defined earlier and then invoke the self.respond ChainOfThought module.

[1] «As far as I remember, High Memory is used for application space and Low Memory for the kernel. Advantage is that (user-space) applications cant access kernel-space memory.»
[2] «HIGHMEM is a range of kernels memory space, but it is NOT memory you access but its a place where you put what you want to access. A typical 32bit Linux virtual memory map is like: 0x00000000-0xbfffffff: user process (3GB) 0xc0000000-0xffffffff: kernel space (1GB) (CPU-specific vector and whatsoever are ignored here). Linux splits the 1GB kernel space into 2 pieces, LOWMEM and HIGHMEM. The split varies from installation to installation. If an installation chooses, say, 512MB-512MB for LOW and HIGH mems, the 512MB LOWMEM (0xc0000000-0xdfffffff) is statically mapped at the kernel boot time; usually the first so many bytes of the physical memory is used for this so that virtual and physical addresses in this range have a constant offset of, say, 0xc0000000. On the other hand, the latter 512MB (HIGHMEM) has no static mapping (although you could leave pages semi-permanently mapped there, but you must do so explicitly in your driver code). Instead, pages are temporarily mapped and unmapped here so that virtual and physical addresses in this range have no consistent mapping. Typical uses of HIGHMEM include single-time data buffers.»
[3] «This is relevant to the Linux kernel; Im not sure how any Unix kernel handles this. The High Memory is the segment of memory that user-space programs can address. It cannot touch Low Memory. Low Memory is the segment of memory that the Linux kernel can address directly. If the kernel must access High Memory, it has to map it into its own address space first. There was a patch introduced recently that lets you control where the segment is. The tradeoff is that you can take addressable memory away from user space so that the kernel can have more memory that it does not have to map before using. Additional resources: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/KernelAnalysis-HOWTO-7.html http://linux-mm.org/HighMemory»
[4] «The first reference to turn to is Linux Device Drivers (available both online and in book form), particularly chapter 15 which has a section on the topic. In an ideal world, every system component would be able to map all the memory it ever needs to access. And this is the case for processes on Linux and most operating systems: a 32-bit process can only access a little less than 2^32 bytes of virtual memory (in fact about 3GB on a typical Linux 32-bit architecture). It gets difficult for the kernel, which needs to be able to map the full memory of the process whose system call its executing, plus the whole physical memory, plus any other memory-mapped hardware device. So when a 32-bit kernel needs to map more than 4GB of memory, it must be compiled with high memory support. High memory is memory which is not permanently mapped in the kernels address space. (Low memory is the opposite: it is always mapped, so you can access it in the kernel simply by dereferencing a pointer.) When you access high memory from kernel code, you need to call kmap first, to obtain a pointer from a page data structure (struct page). Calling kmap works whether the page is in high or low memory. There is also kmap_atomic which has added constraints but is more efficient on multiprocessor machines because it uses finer-grained locking. The pointer obtained through kmap is a resource: it uses up address space. Once youve finished with it, you must call kunmap (or kunmap_atomic) to free that resource; then the pointer is no longer valid, and the contents of the page cant be accessed until you call kmap again.»
[5] «/proc/meminfo will tell you how free works, but /proc/kcore can tell you what the kernel uses. From the same page: /proc/kcore This file represents the physical memory of the system and is stored in the ELF core file format. With this pseudo-file, and an unstripped kernel (/usr/src/linux/vmlinux) binary, GDB can be used to examine the current state of any kernel data structures. The total length of the file is the size of physical memory (RAM) plus 4KB. /proc/meminfo This file reports statistics about memory usage on the system. It is used by free(1) to report the amount of free and used memory (both physical and swap) on the system as well as the shared memory and buffers used by the kernel. Each line of the file consists of a parameter name, followed by a colon, the value of the parameter, and an option unit of measurement (e.g., kB). The list below describes the parameter names and the format specifier required to read the field value. Except as noted below, all of the fields have been present since at least Linux 2.6.0.

Doesnt include SwapCached. SwapCached %lu Memory that once was swapped out, is swapped back in but still also is in the swap file. (If memory pressure is high, these pages dont need to be swapped out again because they are already in the swap file. This saves I/O.)

CommitLimit %lu (since Linux 2.6.10) Based on the overcommit ratio (vm.overcommit_ratio), this is the total amount of memory currently available to be allocated on the system. This limit is adhered to only if strict overcommit accounting is enabled (mode 2 in /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio). The CommitLimit is calculated using the following formula: CommitLimit = ([total RAM pages] - [total huge TLB pages]) * overcommit_ratio / 100 + [total swap pages] For example, on a system with 1GB of physical RAM and 7GB of swap with a overcommit_ratio of 30, this formula yields a CommitLimit of 7.3GB. For more details, see the memory overcommit documentation in the kernel source file Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting. Committed_AS %lu The amount of memory presently allocated on the system. The committed memory is a sum of all of the memory which has been allocated by processes, even if it has not been used by them as of yet. A process which allocates 1GB of memory (using malloc(3) or similar), but touches only 300MB of that memory will show up as using only 300MB of memory even if it has the address space allocated for the entire 1GB. This 1GB is memory which has been committed to by the VM and can be used at any time by the allocating application.

Using a DSPy Optimizer to improve your RAG prompt.¶Off the shelf, our RAG module scores 55%. What are our options to make it stronger? One of the various choices DSPy offers is optimizing the prompts in our pipeline.

Let's set up and use DSPy's MIPRO (v2) optimizer. The run below has a cost around $1.5 (for the medium auto setting) and may take some 20-30 minutes depending on your number of threads.

The prompt optimization process here is pretty systematic, you can learn about it for example in this paper. Importantly, it's not a magic button. It's very possible that it can overfit your training set for instance and not generalize well to a held-out set, making it essential that we iteratively validate our programs.
Let's check on an example here, asking the same question to the baseline rag = RAG() program, which was not optimized, and to the optimized_rag = MIPROv2(..)(..) program, after prompt optimization.
In [20]:
Copied!
baseline = rag(question="cmd+tab does not work on hidden or minimized windows")
print(baseline.response)
baseline = rag(question="cmd+tab does not work on hidden or minimized windows")
print(baseline.response)
You are correct that cmd+tab does not work on hidden or minimized windows. To switch back to a minimized app, you must first switch to another application and let it take focus before returning to the minimized one.
In [21]:
Copied!
pred = optimized_rag(question="cmd+tab does not work on hidden or minimized windows")
print(pred.response)
pred = optimized_rag(question="cmd+tab does not work on hidden or minimized windows")
print(pred.response)
The Command + Tab shortcut on macOS is designed to switch between currently open applications, but it does not directly restore minimized or hidden windows. When you use Command + Tab, it cycles through the applications that are actively running, and minimized windows do not count as active. To manage minimized windows, you can use other shortcuts or methods. For example, you can use Command + Option + H + M to hide all other applications and minimize the most recently used one. Alternatively, you can navigate to the application you want to restore using Command + Tab and then manually click on the minimized window in the Dock to bring it back to focus.
You can use dspy.inspect_history(n=2) to view the RAG prompt before optimization and after optimization.
Concretely, in one of the runs of this notebook, the optimized prompt does the following (note that it may be different on a later rerun).
Constructs the following instruction,
Using the provided `context` and `question`, analyze the information step by step to generate a comprehensive and informative `response`. Ensure that the response clearly explains the concepts involved, highlights key distinctions, and addresses any complexities noted in the context.

What's next?¶Improving from around 42% to approximately 61% on this task, in terms of SemanticF1, was pretty easy.
But DSPy gives you paths to continue iterating on the quality of your system and we have barely scratched the surface.
In general, you have the following tools:
Explore better system architectures for your program, e.g. what if we ask the LM to generate search queries for the retriever? See, e.g., the STORM pipeline built in DSPy.
Explore different prompt optimizers or weight optimizers. See the Optimizers Docs.
Scale inference time compute using DSPy Optimizers, e.g. via ensembling multiple post-optimization programs.
Cut cost by distilling to a smaller LM, via prompt or weight optimization.
How do you decide which ones to proceed with first?
The first step is to look at your system outputs, which will allow you to identify the sources of lower performance if any. While doing all of this, make sure you continue to refine your metric, e.g. by optimizing against your judgments, and to collect more (or more realistic) data, e.g. from related domains or from putting a demo of your system in front of users.

Exploring some basic DSPy Modules.¶You can always prompt the LM directly via lm(prompt="prompt") or lm(messages=[...]). However, DSPy gives you Modules as a better way to define your LM functions.
The simplest module is dspy.Predict. It takes a DSPy Signature, i.e. a structured input/output schema, and gives you back a callable function for the behavior you specified. Let's use the "in-line" notation for signatures to declare a module that takes a question (of type str) as input and produces a response as an output.

In Linux, "high memory" and "low memory" refer to different regions of the system's memory address space, particularly in the context of 32-bit architectures.
- **Low Memory**: This typically refers to the memory that is directly accessible by the kernel. In a 32-bit system, this is usually the first 896 MB of RAM (from 0 to 896 MB). The kernel can directly map this memory, making it faster for the kernel to access and manage. Low memory is used for kernel data structures and for user processes that require direct access to memory.
- **High Memory**: This refers to the memory above the low memory limit, which is not directly accessible by the kernel in a 32-bit system. This area is typically above 896 MB. The kernel cannot directly access this memory without using special mechanisms, such as mapping it into the kernel's address space when needed. High memory is used for user processes that require more memory than what is available in low memory.

- **High Memory**: This refers to the memory above the low memory limit, which is not directly accessible by the kernel in a 32-bit system. This area is typically above 896 MB. The kernel cannot directly access this memory without using special mechanisms, such as mapping it into the kernel's address space when needed. High memory is used for user processes that require more memory than what is available in low memory.
In summary, low memory is directly accessible by the kernel, while high memory requires additional steps for the kernel to access it, especially in 32-bit systems. In 64-bit systems, this distinction is less significant as the kernel can address a much larger memory space directly.

In Linux, "high memory" and "low memory" refer to different regions of the system's memory address space, particularly in the context of 32-bit architectures.
- **Low Memory**: This typically refers to the memory that is directly accessible by the kernel. In a 32-bit system, this is usually the first 896 MB of RAM (from 0 to 896 MB). The kernel can directly map this memory, making it faster for the kernel to access and manage. Low memory is used for kernel data structures and for user processes that require direct access to memory.
- **High Memory**: This refers to the memory above the low memory limit, which is not directly accessible by the kernel in a 32-bit system. This area is typically above 896 MB. The kernel cannot directly access this memory without using special mechanisms, such as mapping it into the kernel's address space when needed. High memory is used for user processes that require more memory than what is available in low memory.
In summary, low memory is directly accessible by the kernel, while high memory requires additional steps for the kernel to access it, especially in 32-bit systems. In 64-bit systems, this distinction is less significant as the kernel can address a much larger memory space directly.

DSPy has various built-in modules, e.g. dspy.ChainOfThought, dspy.ProgramOfThought, and dspy.ReAct. These are interchangeable with basic dspy.Predict: they take your signature, which is specific to your task, and they apply general-purpose prompting techniques and inference-time strategies to it.
For example, dspy.ChainOfThought is an easy way to elicit reasoning out of your LM before it commits to the outputs requested in your signature.
In the example below, we'll omit str types (as the default type is string). You should feel free to experiment with other fields and types, e.g. try topics: list[str] or is_realistic: bool.

Using DSPy well involves evaluation and iterative development.¶You already know a lot about DSPy at this point. If all you want is quick scripting, this much of DSPy already enables a lot. Sprinkling DSPy signatures and modules into your Python control flow is a pretty ergonomic way to just get stuff done with LMs.
That said, you're likely here because you want to build a high-quality system and improve it over time. The way to do that in DSPy is to iterate fast by evaluating the quality of your system and using DSPy's powerful tools, e.g. Optimizers.
Manipulating Examples in DSPy.¶To measure the quality of your DSPy system, you need (1) a bunch of input values, like questions for example, and (2) a metric that can score the quality of an output from your system. Metrics vary widely. Some metrics need ground-truth labels of ideal outputs, e.g. for classification or question answering. Other metrics are self-supervised, e.g. checking faithfulness or lack of hallucination, perhaps using a DSPy program as a judge of these qualities.
Let's load a dataset of questions and their (pretty long) gold answers. Since we started this notebook with the goal of building a system for answering Tech questions, we obtained a bunch of StackExchange-based questions and their correct answers from the RAG-QA Arena dataset.

Given a simple dict like this, let's create a list of dspy.Examples, which is the datatype that carries training (or test) datapoints in DSPy.
When you build a dspy.Example, you should generally specify .with_inputs("field1", "field2", ...) to indicate which fields are inputs. The other fields are treated as labels or metadata.

Now, let's divide the data into:
Training (and with it Validation) set:
These are the splits you typically give to DSPy optimizers.
Optimizers typically learn directly from the training examples and check their progress using the validation examples.
It's good to have 30--300 examples for training and validation each.
For prompt optimizers in particular, it's often better to pass more validation than training.
Below, we'll use 200 in total. MIPROv2 will split them into 20% training and 80% validation if you don't pass a valset.
Development and Test sets: The rest, typically on the order of 30--1000, can be used for:
development (i.e., you can inspect them as you iterate on your system) and
testing (final held-out evaluation).

Evaluation in DSPy.¶What kind of metric can suit our question-answering task? There are many choices, but since the answers are long, we may ask: How well does the system response cover all key facts in the gold response? And the other way around, how well is the system response not saying things that aren't in the gold response?
That metric is essentially a semantic F1, so let's load a SemanticF1 metric from DSPy. This metric is actually implemented as a very simple DSPy module using whatever LM we're working with.

Question: 	 why are my text messages coming up as maybe?
Gold Response: 	 This is part of the Proactivity features new with iOS 9: It looks at info in emails to see if anyone with this number sent you an email and if it finds the phone number associated with a contact from your email, it will show you "Maybe". 
However, it has been suggested there is a bug in iOS 11.2 that can result in "Maybe" being displayed even when "Find Contacts in Other Apps" is disabled.
Predicted Response: 	 Your text messages are showing up as "maybe" because your messaging app is uncertain about the sender's identity. This typically occurs when the sender's number is not saved in your contacts or if the message is from an unknown number. To resolve this, you can save the contact in your address book or check the message settings in your app.

Question: 	 why are my text messages coming up as maybe?
Gold Response: 	 This is part of the Proactivity features new with iOS 9: It looks at info in emails to see if anyone with this number sent you an email and if it finds the phone number associated with a contact from your email, it will show you "Maybe". 
However, it has been suggested there is a bug in iOS 11.2 that can result in "Maybe" being displayed even when "Find Contacts in Other Apps" is disabled.
Predicted Response: 	 Your text messages are showing up as "maybe" because your messaging app is uncertain about the sender's identity. This typically occurs when the sender's number is not saved in your contacts or if the message is from an unknown number. To resolve this, you can save the contact in your address book or check the message settings in your app.

Response:
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
The system response provides a general explanation for why text messages may show up as "maybe," focusing on the uncertainty of the sender's identity. However, it does not mention the specific iOS features or the potential bug in iOS 11.2 that are highlighted in the ground truth. The ground truth explains that this feature is part of iOS 9's Proactivity features and mentions a specific bug in iOS 11.2, which is not addressed in the system response.
[[ ## ground_truth_key_ideas ## ]]
1. Proactivity features introduced in iOS 9.
2. The system checks emails to associate phone numbers with contacts.
3. "Maybe" is displayed if the number is not saved in contacts.
4. Mention of a bug in iOS 11.2 causing "Maybe" to appear incorrectly.
[[ ## system_response_key_ideas ## ]]
1. Text messages show up as "maybe" due to uncertainty about the sender's identity.
2. Occurs when the sender's number is not saved in contacts or is from an unknown number.
3. Suggests saving the contact or checking message settings.
[[ ## discussion ## ]]
There is some overlap between the ground truth and the system response regarding the uncertainty of the sender's identity and the suggestion to save the contact. However, the system response lacks specific details about the iOS features and the bug mentioned in the ground truth. The ground truth provides a more comprehensive explanation of the "maybe" feature, while the system response is more general and does not address the iOS version specifics.

why are my text messages coming up as maybe?
[[ ## ground_truth ## ]]
This is part of the Proactivity features new with iOS 9: It looks at info in emails to see if anyone with this number sent you an email and if it finds the phone number associated with a contact from your email, it will show you "Maybe". 
However, it has been suggested there is a bug in iOS 11.2 that can result in "Maybe" being displayed even when "Find Contacts in Other Apps" is disabled.
[[ ## system_response ## ]]
Your text messages are showing up as "maybe" because your messaging app is uncertain about the sender's identity. This typically occurs when the sender's number is not saved in your contacts or if the message is from an unknown number. To resolve this, you can save the contact in your address book or check the message settings in your app.
Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## ground_truth_key_ideas ## ]]`, then `[[ ## system_response_key_ideas ## ]]`, then `[[ ## discussion ## ]]`, then `[[ ## recall ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python float), then `[[ ## precision ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python float), and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
Response:
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
The system response provides a general explanation for why text messages may show up as "maybe," focusing on the uncertainty of the sender's identity. However, it does not mention the specific iOS features or the potential bug in iOS 11.2 that are highlighted in the ground truth. The ground truth explains that this feature is part of iOS 9's Proactivity features and mentions a specific bug in iOS 11.2, which is not addressed in the system response.
[[ ## ground_truth_key_ideas ## ]]
1. Proactivity features introduced in iOS 9.
2. The system checks emails to associate phone numbers with contacts.
3. "Maybe" is displayed if the number is not saved in contacts.
4. Mention of a bug in iOS 11.2 causing "Maybe" to appear incorrectly.
[[ ## system_response_key_ideas ## ]]
1. Text messages show up as "maybe" due to uncertainty about the sender's identity.
2. Occurs when the sender's number is not saved in contacts or is from an unknown number.
3. Suggests saving the contact or checking message settings.
[[ ## discussion ## ]]
There is some overlap between the ground truth and the system response regarding the uncertainty of the sender's identity and the suggestion to save the contact. However, the system response lacks specific details about the iOS features and the bug mentioned in the ground truth. The ground truth provides a more comprehensive explanation of the "maybe" feature, while the system response is more general and does not address the iOS version specifics.

System message:
Your input fields are:
1. `question` (str)
2. `ground_truth` (str)
3. `system_response` (str)
Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str)
2. `ground_truth_key_ideas` (str): enumeration of key ideas in the ground truth
3. `system_response_key_ideas` (str): enumeration of key ideas in the system response
4. `discussion` (str): discussion of the overlap between ground truth and system response
5. `recall` (float): fraction (out of 1.0) of ground truth covered by the system response
6. `precision` (float): fraction (out of 1.0) of system response covered by the ground truth
All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.
[[ ## question ## ]]

In adhering to this structure, your objective is: 
        Compare a system's response to the ground truth to compute recall and precision of key ideas.
        You will first enumerate key ideas in each response, discuss their overlap, and then report recall and precision.

So far, we built a very simple chain-of-thought module for question answering and evaluated it on a small dataset.
Can we do better? In the rest of this guide, we will build a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) program in DSPy for the same task. We'll see how this can boost the score substantially, then we'll use one of the DSPy Optimizers to compile our RAG program to higher-quality prompts, raising our scores even more.

Build your first RAG Module.¶In the previous guide, we looked at individual DSPy modules in isolation, e.g. dspy.Predict("question -> answer").
What if we want to build a DSPy program that has multiple steps? The syntax below with dspy.Module allows you to connect a few pieces together, in this case, our retriever and a generation module, so the whole system can be optimized.
Concretely, in the __init__ method, you declare any sub-module you'll need, which in this case is just a dspy.ChainOfThought('context, question -> response') module that takes retrieved context, a question, and produces a response. In the forward method, you simply express any Python control flow you like, possibly using your modules. In this case, we first invoke the search function defined earlier and then invoke the self.respond ChainOfThought module.

[1] «As far as I remember, High Memory is used for application space and Low Memory for the kernel. Advantage is that (user-space) applications cant access kernel-space memory.»
[2] «HIGHMEM is a range of kernels memory space, but it is NOT memory you access but its a place where you put what you want to access. A typical 32bit Linux virtual memory map is like: 0x00000000-0xbfffffff: user process (3GB) 0xc0000000-0xffffffff: kernel space (1GB) (CPU-specific vector and whatsoever are ignored here). Linux splits the 1GB kernel space into 2 pieces, LOWMEM and HIGHMEM. The split varies from installation to installation. If an installation chooses, say, 512MB-512MB for LOW and HIGH mems, the 512MB LOWMEM (0xc0000000-0xdfffffff) is statically mapped at the kernel boot time; usually the first so many bytes of the physical memory is used for this so that virtual and physical addresses in this range have a constant offset of, say, 0xc0000000. On the other hand, the latter 512MB (HIGHMEM) has no static mapping (although you could leave pages semi-permanently mapped there, but you must do so explicitly in your driver code). Instead, pages are temporarily mapped and unmapped here so that virtual and physical addresses in this range have no consistent mapping. Typical uses of HIGHMEM include single-time data buffers.»

Low Memory is the segment of memory that the Linux kernel can address directly. If the kernel must access High Memory, it has to map it into its own address space first.

It gets difficult for the kernel, which needs to be able to map the full memory of the process whose system call its executing, plus the whole physical memory, plus any other memory-mapped hardware device. So when a 32-bit kernel needs to map more than 4GB of memory, it must be compiled with high memory support. High memory is memory which is not permanently mapped in the kernels address space.

what are high memory and low memory on linux?
Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## response ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
Response:
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
High Memory and Low Memory in Linux refer to two segments of the kernel's memory space. Low Memory is the portion of memory that the kernel can access directly and is statically mapped at boot time. This area is typically used for kernel data structures and is always accessible to the kernel. High Memory, on the other hand, is not permanently mapped in the kernel's address space, meaning that the kernel cannot access it directly without first mapping it into its address space. High Memory is used for user-space applications and temporary data buffers. The distinction allows for better memory management and security, as user-space applications cannot directly access kernel-space memory.

In Linux, High Memory refers to the segment of memory that is not permanently mapped in the kernel's address space, which means the kernel must map it temporarily to access it. This area is typically used for user-space applications and temporary data buffers. Low Memory, in contrast, is the portion of memory that the kernel can access directly and is statically mapped at boot time. It is used for kernel data structures and is always accessible to the kernel. This separation enhances security by preventing user-space applications from accessing kernel-space memory directly.

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
High Memory and Low Memory in Linux refer to two segments of the kernel's memory space. Low Memory is the portion of memory that the kernel can access directly and is statically mapped at boot time. This area is typically used for kernel data structures and is always accessible to the kernel. High Memory, on the other hand, is not permanently mapped in the kernel's address space, meaning that the kernel cannot access it directly without first mapping it into its address space. High Memory is used for user-space applications and temporary data buffers. The distinction allows for better memory management and security, as user-space applications cannot directly access kernel-space memory.

[1] «As far as I remember, High Memory is used for application space and Low Memory for the kernel. Advantage is that (user-space) applications cant access kernel-space memory.»
[2] «HIGHMEM is a range of kernels memory space, but it is NOT memory you access but its a place where you put what you want to access. A typical 32bit Linux virtual memory map is like: 0x00000000-0xbfffffff: user process (3GB) 0xc0000000-0xffffffff: kernel space (1GB) (CPU-specific vector and whatsoever are ignored here). Linux splits the 1GB kernel space into 2 pieces, LOWMEM and HIGHMEM. The split varies from installation to installation. If an installation chooses, say, 512MB-512MB for LOW and HIGH mems, the 512MB LOWMEM (0xc0000000-0xdfffffff) is statically mapped at the kernel boot time; usually the first so many bytes of the physical memory is used for this so that virtual and physical addresses in this range have a constant offset of, say, 0xc0000000. On the other hand, the latter 512MB (HIGHMEM) has no static mapping (although you could leave pages semi-permanently mapped there, but you must do so explicitly in your driver code). Instead, pages are temporarily mapped and unmapped here so that virtual and physical addresses in this range have no consistent mapping. Typical uses of HIGHMEM include single-time data buffers.»
[3] «This is relevant to the Linux kernel; Im not sure how any Unix kernel handles this. The High Memory is the segment of memory that user-space programs can address. It cannot touch Low Memory. Low Memory is the segment of memory that the Linux kernel can address directly. If the kernel must access High Memory, it has to map it into its own address space first. There was a patch introduced recently that lets you control where the segment is. The tradeoff is that you can take addressable memory away from user space so that the kernel can have more memory that it does not have to map before using. Additional resources: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/KernelAnalysis-HOWTO-7.html http://linux-mm.org/HighMemory»
[4] «The first reference to turn to is Linux Device Drivers (available both online and in book form), particularly chapter 15 which has a section on the topic. In an ideal world, every system component would be able to map all the memory it ever needs to access. And this is the case for processes on Linux and most operating systems: a 32-bit process can only access a little less than 2^32 bytes of virtual memory (in fact about 3GB on a typical Linux 32-bit architecture). It gets difficult for the kernel, which needs to be able to map the full memory of the process whose system call its executing, plus the whole physical memory, plus any other memory-mapped hardware device. So when a 32-bit kernel needs to map more than 4GB of memory, it must be compiled with high memory support. High memory is memory which is not permanently mapped in the kernels address space. (Low memory is the opposite: it is always mapped, so you can access it in the kernel simply by dereferencing a pointer.) When you access high memory from kernel code, you need to call kmap first, to obtain a pointer from a page data structure (struct page). Calling kmap works whether the page is in high or low memory. There is also kmap_atomic which has added constraints but is more efficient on multiprocessor machines because it uses finer-grained locking. The pointer obtained through kmap is a resource: it uses up address space. Once youve finished with it, you must call kunmap (or kunmap_atomic) to free that resource; then the pointer is no longer valid, and the contents of the page cant be accessed until you call kmap again.»

A typical 32bit Linux virtual memory map is like: 0x00000000-0xbfffffff: user process (3GB) 0xc0000000-0xffffffff: kernel space (1GB) (CPU-specific vector and whatsoever are ignored here). Linux splits the 1GB kernel space into 2 pieces, LOWMEM and HIGHMEM. The split varies from installation to installation. If an installation chooses, say, 512MB-512MB for LOW and HIGH mems, the 512MB LOWMEM (0xc0000000-0xdfffffff) is statically mapped at the kernel boot time; usually the first so many bytes of the physical memory is used for this so that virtual and physical addresses in this range have a constant offset of, say, 0xc0000000. On the other hand, the latter 512MB (HIGHMEM) has no static mapping (although you could leave pages semi-permanently mapped there, but you must do so explicitly in your driver code). Instead, pages are temporarily mapped and unmapped here so that virtual and physical addresses in this range have no consistent mapping. Typical uses of HIGHMEM include single-time data buffers.»
[3] «This is relevant to the Linux kernel; Im not sure how any Unix kernel handles this. The High Memory is the segment of memory that user-space programs can address. It cannot touch Low Memory. Low Memory is the segment of memory that the Linux kernel can address directly. If the kernel must access High Memory, it has to map it into its own address space first. There was a patch introduced recently that lets you control where the segment is. The tradeoff is that you can take addressable memory away from user space so that the kernel can have more memory that it does not have to map before using. Additional resources: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/KernelAnalysis-HOWTO-7.html http://linux-mm.org/HighMemory»
[4] «The first reference to turn to is Linux Device Drivers (available both online and in book form), particularly chapter 15 which has a section on the topic. In an ideal world, every system component would be able to map all the memory it ever needs to access. And this is the case for processes on Linux and most operating systems: a 32-bit process can only access a little less than 2^32 bytes of virtual memory (in fact about 3GB on a typical Linux 32-bit architecture). It gets difficult for the kernel, which needs to be able to map the full memory of the process whose system call its executing, plus the whole physical memory, plus any other memory-mapped hardware device. So when a 32-bit kernel needs to map more than 4GB of memory, it must be compiled with high memory support. High memory is memory which is not permanently mapped in the kernels address space. (Low memory is the opposite: it is always mapped, so you can access it in the kernel simply by dereferencing a pointer.) When you access high memory from kernel code, you need to call kmap first, to obtain a pointer from a page data structure (struct page). Calling kmap works whether the page is in high or low memory. There is also kmap_atomic which has added constraints but is more efficient on multiprocessor machines because it uses finer-grained locking. The pointer obtained through kmap is a resource: it uses up address space. Once youve finished with it, you must call kunmap (or kunmap_atomic) to free that resource; then the pointer is no longer valid, and the contents of the page cant be accessed until you call kmap again.»
[5] «/proc/meminfo will tell you how free works, but /proc/kcore can tell you what the kernel uses. From the same page: /proc/kcore This file represents the physical memory of the system and is stored in the ELF core file format. With this pseudo-file, and an unstripped kernel (/usr/src/linux/vmlinux) binary, GDB can be used to examine the current state of any kernel data structures. The total length of the file is the size of physical memory (RAM) plus 4KB. /proc/meminfo This file reports statistics about memory usage on the system. It is used by free(1) to report the amount of free and used memory (both physical and swap) on the system as well as the shared memory and buffers used by the kernel. Each line of the file consists of a parameter name, followed by a colon, the value of the parameter, and an option unit of measurement (e.g., kB). The list below describes the parameter names and the format specifier required to read the field value. Except as noted below, all of the fields have been present since at least Linux 2.6.0.

Buffers %lu Relatively temporary storage for raw disk blocks that shouldnt get tremendously large (20MB or so). Cached %lu In-memory cache for files read from the disk (the page cache). Doesnt include SwapCached. SwapCached %lu Memory that once was swapped out, is swapped back in but still also is in the swap file. (If memory pressure is high, these pages dont need to be swapped out again because they are already in the swap file. This saves I/O.) Active %lu Memory that has been used more recently and usually not reclaimed unless absolutely necessary. Inactive %lu Memory which has been less recently used.

[To be documented.] HighTotal %lu (Starting with Linux 2.6.19, CONFIG_HIGHMEM is required.) Total amount of highmem. Highmem is all memory above ~860MB of physical memory. Highmem areas are for use by user-space programs, or for the page cache. The kernel must use tricks to access this memory, making it slower to access than lowmem. HighFree %lu (Starting with Linux 2.6.19, CONFIG_HIGHMEM is required.) Amount of free highmem. LowTotal %lu (Starting with Linux 2.6.19, CONFIG_HIGHMEM is required.) Total amount of lowmem. Lowmem is memory which can be used for everything that highmem can be used for, but it is also available for the kernels use for its own data structures. Among many other things, it is where everything from Slab is allocated. Bad things happen when youre out of lowmem. LowFree %lu (Starting with Linux 2.6.19, CONFIG_HIGHMEM is required.) Amount of free lowmem. MmapCopy %lu (since Linux 2.6.29) (CONFIG_MMU is required.) [To be documented.] SwapTotal %lu Total amount of swap space available. SwapFree %lu Amount of swap space that is currently unused. Dirty %lu Memory which is waiting to get written back to the disk. Writeback %lu Memory which is actively being written back to the disk. AnonPages %lu (since Linux 2.6.18) Non-file backed pages mapped into user-space page tables. Mapped %lu Files which have been mmaped, such as libraries.

[To be documented.] NFS_Unstable %lu (since Linux 2.6.18) NFS pages sent to the server, but not yet committed to stable storage. Bounce %lu (since Linux 2.6.18) Memory used for block device bounce buffers. WritebackTmp %lu (since Linux 2.6.26) Memory used by FUSE for temporary writeback buffers. CommitLimit %lu (since Linux 2.6.10) Based on the overcommit ratio (vm.overcommit_ratio), this is the total amount of memory currently available to be allocated on the system. This limit is adhered to only if strict overcommit accounting is enabled (mode 2 in /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio). The CommitLimit is calculated using the following formula: CommitLimit = ([total RAM pages] - [total huge TLB pages]) * overcommit_ratio / 100 + [total swap pages] For example, on a system with 1GB of physical RAM and 7GB of swap with a overcommit_ratio of 30, this formula yields a CommitLimit of 7.3GB. For more details, see the memory overcommit documentation in the kernel source file Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting. Committed_AS %lu The amount of memory presently allocated on the system. The committed memory is a sum of all of the memory which has been allocated by processes, even if it has not been used by them as of yet. A process which allocates 1GB of memory (using malloc(3) or similar), but touches only 300MB of that memory will show up as using only 300MB of memory even if it has the address space allocated for the entire 1GB. This 1GB is memory which has been committed to by the VM and can be used at any time by the allocating application.

what are high memory and low memory on linux?
Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## response ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
Response:
[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
High Memory and Low Memory in Linux refer to two segments of the kernel's memory space. Low Memory is the portion of memory that the kernel can access directly and is statically mapped at boot time. This area is typically used for kernel data structures and is always accessible to the kernel. High Memory, on the other hand, is not permanently mapped in the kernel's address space, meaning that the kernel cannot access it directly without first mapping it into its address space. High Memory is used for user-space applications and temporary data buffers. The distinction allows for better memory management and security, as user-space applications cannot directly access kernel-space memory.
[[ ## response ## ]]
In Linux, High Memory refers to the segment of memory that is not permanently mapped in the kernel's address space, which means the kernel must map it temporarily to access it. This area is typically used for user-space applications and temporary data buffers. Low Memory, in contrast, is the portion of memory that the kernel can access directly and is statically mapped at boot time. It is used for kernel data structures and is always accessible to the kernel. This separation enhances security by preventing user-space applications from accessing kernel-space memory directly.

The prompt optimization process here is pretty systematic, you can learn about it for example in this paper. Importantly, it's not a magic button. It's very possible that it can overfit your training set for instance and not generalize well to a held-out set, making it essential that we iteratively validate our programs.
Let's check on an example here, asking the same question to the baseline rag = RAG() program, which was not optimized, and to the optimized_rag = MIPROv2(..)(..) program, after prompt optimization.

When you use Command + Tab, it cycles through the applications that are actively running, and minimized windows do not count as active. To manage minimized windows, you can use other shortcuts or methods. For example, you can use Command + Option + H + M to hide all other applications and minimize the most recently used one.

What's next?¶Improving from around 42% to approximately 61% on this task, in terms of SemanticF1, was pretty easy.
But DSPy gives you paths to continue iterating on the quality of your system and we have barely scratched the surface.
In general, you have the following tools:
Explore better system architectures for your program, e.g. what if we ask the LM to generate search queries for the retriever? See, e.g., the STORM pipeline built in DSPy.
Explore different prompt optimizers or weight optimizers. See the Optimizers Docs.
Scale inference time compute using DSPy Optimizers, e.g. via ensembling multiple post-optimization programs.
Cut cost by distilling to a smaller LM, via prompt or weight optimization.
How do you decide which ones to proceed with first?
The first step is to look at your system outputs, which will allow you to identify the sources of lower performance if any. While doing all of this, make sure you continue to refine your metric, e.g. by optimizing against your judgments, and to collect more (or more realistic) data, e.g. from related domains or from putting a demo of your system in front of users.

### Tutorial: Saving and Loading your DSPy program
This guide demonstrates how to save and load your DSPy program. At a high level, there are two ways to save your DSPy program:
- Save the state of the program only, similar to weights-only saving in PyTorch.
- Save the whole program, including both the architecture and the state, which is supported by dspy>=2.6.0.
`dspy>=2.6.0`
## State-only Saving
State represents the DSPy program's internal state, including the signature, demos (few-shot examples), and other informaiton like
the lm to use for each dspy.Predict in the program. It also includes configurable attributes of other DSPy modules like
k for dspy.retrievers.Retriever. To save the state of a program, use the save method and set save_program=False. You can
choose to save the state to a JSON file or a pickle file. We recommend saving the state to a JSON file because it is safer and readable.
But sometimes your program contains non-serializable objects like dspy.Image or datetime.datetime, in which case you should save
the state to a pickle file.
`lm`
`dspy.Predict`
`k`
`dspy.retrievers.Retriever`
`save`
`save_program=False`
`dspy.Image`
`datetime.datetime`
Let's say we have compiled a program with some data, and we want to save the program for future usage:
```python
import dspy
from dspy.datasets.gsm8k import GSM8K, gsm8k_metric
dspy.settings.configure(lm=dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini"))
gsm8k = GSM8K()
gsm8k_trainset = gsm8k.train[:10]
dspy_program = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer")
optimizer = dspy.BootstrapFewShot(metric=gsm8k_metric, max_bootstrapped_demos=4, max_labeled_demos=4, max_rounds=5)
compiled_dspy_program = optimizer.compile(dspy_program, trainset=gsm8k_trainset)
```
import dspy
from dspy.datasets.gsm8k import GSM8K, gsm8k_metric
dspy.settings.configure(lm=dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini"))
gsm8k = GSM8K()
gsm8k_trainset = gsm8k.train[:10]
dspy_program = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer")
optimizer = dspy.BootstrapFewShot(metric=gsm8k_metric, max_bootstrapped_demos=4, max_labeled_demos=4, max_rounds=5)
compiled_dspy_program = optimizer.compile(dspy_program, trainset=gsm8k_trainset)
To save the state of your program to json file:
```python
compiled_dspy_program.save("./dspy_program/program.json", save_program=False)
```
compiled_dspy_program.save("./dspy_program/program.json", save_program=False)
To save the state of your program to a pickle file:
```python
compiled_dspy_program.save("./dspy_program/program.pkl", save_program=False)
```
compiled_dspy_program.save("./dspy_program/program.pkl", save_program=False)
To load your saved state, you need to recreate the same program, then load the state using the load method.
`load`
```python
loaded_dspy_program = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer") # Recreate the same program.
loaded_dspy_program.load("./dspy_program/program.json")
assert len(compiled_dspy_program.demos) == len(loaded_dspy_program.demos)
for original_demo, loaded_demo in zip(compiled_dspy_program.demos, loaded_dspy_program.demos):
    # Loaded demo is a dict, while the original demo is a dspy.Example.
    assert original_demo.toDict() == loaded_demo
assert str(compiled_dspy_program.signature) == str(loaded_dspy_program.signature)
```
loaded_dspy_program = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer") # Recreate the same program.
loaded_dspy_program.load("./dspy_program/program.json")
assert len(compiled_dspy_program.demos) == len(loaded_dspy_program.demos)
for original_demo, loaded_demo in zip(compiled_dspy_program.demos, loaded_dspy_program.demos):
    # Loaded demo is a dict, while the original demo is a dspy.Example.
    assert original_demo.toDict() == loaded_demo
assert str(compiled_dspy_program.signature) == str(loaded_dspy_program.signature)
Or load the state from a pickle file:
```python
loaded_dspy_program = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer") # Recreate the same program.
loaded_dspy_program.load("./dspy_program/program.pkl")
assert len(compiled_dspy_program.demos) == len(loaded_dspy_program.demos)
for original_demo, loaded_demo in zip(compiled_dspy_program.demos, loaded_dspy_program.demos):
    # Loaded demo is a dict, while the original demo is a dspy.Example.
    assert original_demo.toDict() == loaded_demo
assert str(compiled_dspy_program.signature) == str(loaded_dspy_program.signature)
```
loaded_dspy_program = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer") # Recreate the same program.
loaded_dspy_program.load("./dspy_program/program.pkl")
assert len(compiled_dspy_program.demos) == len(loaded_dspy_program.demos)
for original_demo, loaded_demo in zip(compiled_dspy_program.demos, loaded_dspy_program.demos):
    # Loaded demo is a dict, while the original demo is a dspy.Example.
    assert original_demo.toDict() == loaded_demo
assert str(compiled_dspy_program.signature) == str(loaded_dspy_program.signature)
## Whole Program Saving
Starting from dspy>=2.6.0, DSPy supports saving the whole program, including the architecture and the state. This feature
is powered by cloudpickle, which is a library for serializing and deserializing Python objects.
`cloudpickle`
To save the whole program, use the save method and set save_program=True, and specify a directory path to save the program
instead of a file name. We require a directory path because we also save some metadata, e.g., the dependency versions along
with the program itself.
`save_program=True`
```python
compiled_dspy_program.save("./dspy_program/", save_program=True)
```
compiled_dspy_program.save("./dspy_program/", save_program=True)
To load the saved program, directly use dspy.load method:
`dspy.load`
```python
loaded_dspy_program = dspy.load("./dspy_program/")
assert len(compiled_dspy_program.demos) == len(loaded_dspy_program.demos)
for original_demo, loaded_demo in zip(compiled_dspy_program.demos, loaded_dspy_program.demos):
    # Loaded demo is a dict, while the original demo is a dspy.Example.
    assert original_demo.toDict() == loaded_demo
assert str(compiled_dspy_program.signature) == str(loaded_dspy_program.signature)
```
loaded_dspy_program = dspy.load("./dspy_program/")
assert len(compiled_dspy_program.demos) == len(loaded_dspy_program.demos)
for original_demo, loaded_demo in zip(compiled_dspy_program.demos, loaded_dspy_program.demos):
    # Loaded demo is a dict, while the original demo is a dspy.Example.
    assert original_demo.toDict() == loaded_demo
assert str(compiled_dspy_program.signature) == str(loaded_dspy_program.signature)
With whole program saving, you don't need to recreate the program, but can directly load the architecture along with the state.
You can pick the suitable saviing approach based on your needs.
## Backward Compatibility
As of dspy<2.7, we don't guarantee the backward compatibility of the saved program. For example, if you save the program with dspy==2.5.35,
at loading time please make sure to use the same version of DSPy to load the program, otherwise the program may not work as expected. Chances
are that loading a saved file in a different version of DSPy will not raise an error, but the performance could be different from when
the program was saved.
`dspy<2.7`
`dspy==2.5.35`
Starting from dspy>=2.7, we will guarantee the backward compatibility of the saved program in major releases, i.e., programs saved in dspy==2.7.0
should be loadeable in dspy==2.7.10.
`dspy>=2.7`
`dspy==2.7.0`
`dspy==2.7.10`
